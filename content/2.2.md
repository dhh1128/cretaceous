Benal’s knee jammed against the dwelling's central support trunk. He'd outgrown the space again, a tangle of limbs folded onto a low stool. He erased a line of symbols with his thumb, smearing the slate.

The equation stared back, mocking him. It was an anchor, a fixed point, but it drifted.

His hearing, always too sharp, pulled the outside world in. Three dwellings over, a yazhi fussed. Far below, at the perimeter, Keo’s sharp, two-note whistle for Noli. And, just outside the privacy screen, his father’s approach.

The footfalls were heavy, resigned.

The screen rattled aside. Tavan stood there, a broad man who filled the doorway. He smelled of cycad mulch and sweat. His gaze went from the slate to Benal, and his expression settled. Not anger. Pity.

"Still staring at those dead symbols, son?"

Benal’s jaw tightened. "They're not dead. It's the anchor equation."

Tavan sighed. The sound was a low gust, like wind leaving a cave. "Alira died, Benal. The kiva is failing. This..." He waved a thick hand at the slate. "...this won't feed the cultures. Go help Rano. Shift some stone. Do something real."

He didn't wait for an answer. The screen rattled shut.

Do something real.

Benal’s gaze dropped to his own hands. Long, thin fingers, stained with chalk, not dirt. Good for symbols.

Useless for stone.

He picked up the chalk. The dwelling felt smaller, the walls pressing in. His own frustration was a cold, familiar weight in his chest.
