The kiva smelled wrong.
Teva stood at the back of the small crowd, eight adults pressed into the dim chamber, and tried to name what was different. Not the usual mineral coolness of the limestone, not the faint yeast-sweetness of the nutrient broths. Something else. Something dying.
Her grandmother knelt before the protocol wall, her gnarled hands hovering over the ceramic sequence blocks. Omya had been a Master Keeper for forty years. She could assemble protein chains in her sleep. She had assembled them in her sleep, according to Teva's mother, back when—
Teva cut the thought. Her mother was gone. Two years, three months. The parasites had eaten her from the inside while the Council debated whether to risk a journey to the Archive for the synthesis protocols that might have saved her.
"Omya." Rano's voice was gentle but carried an edge Teva had never heard before. The journeyman Keeper stood beside the test array, his face unreadable in the weak light. "Position one-zero-seven. Twenty iterations."
The chamber's bioluminescence had dimmed to almost nothing. Where the culture vessels along the walls once glowed—the cobalt of the immunity strain, the soft amber of bone-density, the pale green of the metabolic optimizer—now only the centers of each ceramic pot held light. The edges had gone dark, the cultures receding like puddles evaporating in drought.
Omya lifted the first block. Cedar-brown, hexagonal. She turned it in her fingers, frowning.
The child's breathing changed.
Teva's eyes snapped to the corner where Alira's mother crouched, the yazhi cradled against her chest. Two and a half years old. Should have had her first immunity Seeding six months ago. Would have had it, if the cultures hadn't started failing, if Grandmother hadn't started forgetting, if the flood hadn't taken the other two Masters in a single night of rain and rushing water.
The stingburn on Alira's arm had been nothing. A crawler bite, the kind every child got. But without the upgrade, the infection had spread. Now the yazhi's skin burned with fever, her breath coming in shallow gasps that shouldn't belong to something so small.
"Omya," Rano said again, softer.
Grandmother set down the cedar block. Picked up another—pearl-white, triangular. Set it down. Her hands shook.
The nutrient compound sat in its mixing vessel beside the test array, untouched. Teva could see its surface from here: the thin, oily film catching what little light remained, the pale amber broth beneath smelling faintly of copper and honey. It would feed the cultures. Keep them alive another day. But only if Grandmother could remember the synthesis protocol. Only if she could pass the test and prove she still held the knowledge to teach the journeymen how to make more.
Three weeks. Three weeks since the flood. Three weeks of the journeymen trying to recreate the compound from memory, producing batches that almost worked, that kept the cultures from dying outright but didn't let them thrive. Three weeks of colors fading from the edges inward.
Three weeks of Alira burning.
"The cedar block," one of the adults murmured behind Teva. "That's position one-zero-eight, not—"
"Silence," Rano snapped.
Omya's hands moved again. Cedar-brown. Then pearl-white. Then... she hesitated. The next block in the sequence should have been rust-red, pentagonal. Teva had watched her grandmother assemble this chain a hundred times as a child, mesmerized by the rhythm of it, the certainty. The immunity protocol was Omya's specialty. She knew it like breathing.
She picked up a yellow square.
Wrong.
Teva's fingernails bit into her palms.
Rust-red. Then moss-green cylinder. Then obsidian hexagonal. Then pearl-white again. Twenty iterations of a sequence that would tell the journeymen which amino acids, in what proportions, in what order. The recipe for the compound that would feed the immunity culture. The culture that would have saved Alira. That would save the next yazhi, and the next, and the next.
If Grandmother could remember.
She placed the yellow square in position one-zero-eight. Reached for another block. Her fingers trembled over the array, hovering, uncertain.
"Grandmother," Teva whispered, knowing she shouldn't speak, unable to stop herself. "The rust-red. It's the—"
"No coaching." Rano's voice was flat. "She must demonstrate independent recall."
Alira made a sound. Not a cry—she was too weak for that now. Just a small exhalation, the kind that meant the pain had spiked again, that the septicemia was spreading through blood vessels too small and new to fight it.
Omya's hand closed on the rust-red block.
For a moment, Teva felt something like hope kindle in her chest.
Her grandmother turned it over. Studying it. Her lips moved, counting facets that Teva knew she'd counted ten thousand times before. The block was rust-red, pentagonal, slightly larger than the pearl-white. Position one-zero-eight in the immunity chain. The first step in the sequence that would let Rano and the other journeymen synthesize the compound that would save the cultures that would create the viral vectors that would stop children from dying of stingburns.
Omya set it aside.
She picked up a blue cylinder.
"No," Teva breathed.
The word hung in the cool air. No one else spoke. Eight adults watching a Master Keeper fail the most basic test of her calling. Watching two hundred and six years of preserved knowledge slip through failing neurons like water through cupped hands.
Rano waited. Gave Grandmother the dignity of completing the sequence. Blue cylinder. Cedar-brown hexagon. Another yellow square. Pearl-white. Each block placed with trembling conviction in positions that made no chemical sense, that would produce a compound that would poison the cultures instead of feeding them.
When Omya placed the twentieth block, Rano's face showed nothing at all.
"Thank you, Master," he said quietly. "Please rest."
Omya looked up at him, and for a moment her eyes were clear. Teva saw her grandmother know, saw the recognition of failure wash across her weathered face. Then the confusion returned, the milky distance that had been claiming her piece by piece since the flood.
"Did I...?" Omya's voice was thin. "The rust-red goes first. I know the rust-red goes first."
"It's all right, Grandmother." Rano helped her stand, his gentleness somehow worse than anger would have been. "You're tired."
"I taught you," Omya said, clutching at his arm. "I taught you the immunity sequence. You remember. The rust-red—"
"I remember what you taught me." Rano's voice cracked. Just for a moment. "I remember most of it."
Most.
The word landed like a stone in still water. Most. Not all. The journeymen knew most of the protocols. They could make compounds that almost worked. They could keep the cultures alive a little longer, burning through the precious reserves while the colors faded from the edges, while the children died of infections that shouldn't kill anyone, that hadn't killed anyone in six generations.
Alira gasped.
Her mother made a sound—not quite a word, not quite a sob. The yazhi's eyes had rolled back, showing crescents of white. Her small body jerked once, twice, fighting something her unupgraded immune system had no weapons against.
"Please," her mother whispered to the darkness. To the dim cultures. To Rano. To anyone. "Please, she's only—"
Alira went still.
The silence that followed wasn't peaceful. It was the silence of air rushing out of lungs that would never fill again. The silence of a heart stopping because the blood had turned toxic, because bacteria had learned to make a home in vessels meant for oxygen and life.
The silence of a world that had forgotten how to save itself.
Teva didn't remember moving. She was suddenly at the rope ladder, climbing up toward the surface, toward air that didn't smell like dying light and failing memory. Behind her, someone was crying. Alira's mother, probably. Or Grandmother, lucid enough to understand what her failing mind had just cost them.
She pulled herself up into the night, into the humid darkness under the tree canopy, and stood there breathing hard. Her hands were shaking. Her throat burned.
No one had stopped her from leaving. No one had called her back. Because what was there to say? Another yazhi dead. More dying, their Seedings delayed while the journeymen struggled to recreate protocols from incomplete memories. The cultures fading, day by day, color by color, from edges to center until there was nothing left but darkness and empty ceramic pots.
The rage came then. Clean and cold and absolutely certain.
She had watched her mother die because the Council was too afraid to act. Too paralyzed by tradition and fear of paradox to send anyone to the Archive for the protocols that might have saved her. And now she'd watched Alira die for the same reason. Another yazhi, another preventable death, another sacrifice to the Council's cowardice.
No more.
The thought crystallized in her mind with perfect clarity. She didn't know how yet. Didn't know who would help her or how they'd survive the journey or what they'd find when they got there.
But she knew this: she was done watching children die because the adults were too afraid to move.
She was going to the Archive.
