They found the springs by accident.

The jungle, for a kilometer, had thinned from a dense, wet green to a sparse, almost brittle forest. The air grew drier. The ground under Keo's boots turned chalky and warm.

Benal, walking point, had stopped. "Chemical," he said, his voice tinny through his suit's external speaker. He tapped the side of his helmet. "Atmospheric. Sulfur."

Keo sniffed. Benal was right. The air held a faint tang, like a gennie running too hot.

"Smells like it's going to blow," Keo said. He nudged Noli forward with a gentle push in her mind. The dromaeosaur was wary, her feathers tight.

"It's geothermal," Benal said, stepping into a wide clearing. "Not a generator. Hydrogen sulfide."

Keo and Teva followed him out of the trees. The clearing was a basin of pale, yellow-stained rock. Steam rose in lazy columns from a dozen pools, some no bigger than his hand, one as wide as a dwelling. The water was turquoise, still as glass.

"Watch your thermals," Kea heard Teva mutter, more to herself than to them. She stepped to the edge of the largest pool, her suit's external sensors whirring faintly. "Water temp is... high. Forty degrees. Not boiling. It's safe."

"Safe" was a word they had not used in days. The tension that had lived in Keo's shoulders since the river crossing began to unspool. The steam-heavy air felt good on his bare arms. He saw Benal sit on a shelf of dry rock, his movements stiff in the suit. Even Teva seemed to relax, her helmet turning to scan the perimeter, but slower this time.

Noli, reassured by Keo's calm, chirped and began to investigate a patch of tough, wire-like ferns.

"Lunch," Keo said. The word felt loud in the stillness.

He dropped his fieldpack and pulled out a square of pan and two strips of dried carne. He split the food. He offered a piece to Teva. She'd retracted her faceplate. Her face was pale, slick with sweat inside her suit. She took the pan without a word and sat, her back to a rock, her spear laid across her knees.

Keo sat near Benal, who was tapping at his wrist display. "You're trapped in that thing," Keo said, holding out the carne.

Benal looked up. "My suit is functioning at ninety-four percent efficiency. The filters are handling the sulfur. I'm fine." He retracted his own faceplate. The sudden rush of humid air made him cough, a rattling sound from deep in his chest. But he took the carne. "Thank you."

Keo grinned. "You're welcome."

He turned and whistled two notes. Noli's head snapped up. She trotted over, her sickle-claws clicking on the stone. She butted her feathered head against Keo's chest.

He laughed, a sound that surprised him. He felt light. They were making it. His hubris, his choice to leave the suit, felt right. He was here, feeling the warmth, breathing the strange air. Teva and Benal were just visiting.

"Here, you monster," he whispered, holding up the last piece of carne. He rubbed her snout, his mind full of the simple, warm feeling of good-pack-good-food. Noli purred, a low rumble in her chest.

He tossed the carne high. "Up."

Noli coiled, her powerful legs bunching, and sprang.

---

A shadow blotted the sky.

Or not a shadow. It was a shape, a vast, dark cross that erased the sky.

Air tore above them. A sound like a thousand sails ripping at once.

Noli shrieked.

A high, thin, bird-like sound, cut in half.

Keo spun, his hand flying to the spear that wasn't there. He’d left it by his pack.

The air slammed into him, a wall of wind that smelled of dust and musk. It knocked him from his seat.

He looked up.

Nothing.

The sky was empty, pale blue. The steam from the springs rose in the same lazy columns. Benal was frozen, hand halfway to his faceplate. Teva was already in a crouch, spear up, helmet scanning the sky.

"What—" Keo started.

A single, mottled feather, as long as his forearm, twisted in the steam. It landed on the yellow stone, inches from his boot.

Noli was gone.

---

Keo’s hand, stuck in the air, slowly fell.

He reached for the bond, the warm thread in his mind that was Noli.

It was not there.

It was gone. Severed. The space in his head felt ripped open, cold. He felt... hollow.

"Report," Teva's voice snapped, hard and metallic over her speaker. "Status."

Keo could not speak. He stared at the feather.

He saw Benal, his face pale as the sulfur-rock, his head tilted back, listening to the empty sky. "Gone," Benal whispered, his voice shaking. "I... I heard the bones. In the air. It was... big. Quetzalcoatlus. Fast."

Keo looked at Teva. She was already on her feet, repacking the food, her faceplate hiding her expression. Her movements were sharp. She bent, grabbed Keo's fieldpack, and slung it over her free shoulder. Two packs. She grunted at the weight.

She came to him. He was still sitting on the rock. She nudged his arm with her armored boot. It was not a kind touch. It was a command.

"Keo. We move. Now. Before it comes back."

He didn't move. He couldn't. His bravado, his lightness, his confidence. All of it was gone. Snatched away. He was just a boy, sleeveless, weaponless, sitting on a warm rock.

Benal finally moved. He walked stiffly, his tall frame a rigid line, and stood near Keo. A thin, tense shadow, his own spear held in a white-tube grip. He just stood there, watching the sky.

Teva nudged him again, harder. "Get up. Keo. Get up."

Keo looked at the feather, now settling on the damp, yellow-stained ground. He looked at the spot where Noli had been.

He stood.

He followed.
