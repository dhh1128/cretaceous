Four days. The savanna was endless. The sun was a hammer.

Keo felt reborn.

After the claustrophobic, green-black gloom of the jungle, the open air was his element. The grief for his betrayal was a cold knot in his gut, but here, he was in control.

His upgrades hummed. His skin, exposed to the air, regulated his temperature perfectly. His enhanced metabolism burned energy with clean efficiency. He felt strong. He felt fast. He glanced back at Teva and Benal, lumbering in their heavy, mud-caked suits.

They looked slow. Vulnerable.

See? he thought, a spike of bitter pride. This is why I didn't take one. He was unburdened. He was the protector. His hubris, which had felt thin at the repository, now felt like armor.

"Stay close," he called back, his voice crisp. "I'll watch the ridges."

Teva hated him.

She hated his easy stride. She hated the sun. Most of all, she hated the suit.

It was supposed to help her. Her body’s own thermal regulation was poor, and the suit was her lifeline. But in this relentless, open heat, the suit was failing.

The thermal management system was losing. Heat built up inside the sealed fabric faster than the phase-change materials could handle it.

She was cooking.

Her head swam. The world had a shimmering, watery edge. Keo, a dozen paces ahead, was just a dark shape.

"Keo..." she tried to say, but her tongue was thick.

He looked back, his impatience obvious. "What? Keep up, Teva!"

She nodded, pushing down the dizziness. She couldn't be weak. Not after her suit had performed so well in the first days. She was the navigator.

She focused on her internal compass. Southeast. One foot. Then the next.

The suit's internal display flashed a red warning. Heat alert. Seek shade. Reduce core temp.

She was dizzy, near collapse, but she locked her knees and kept walking, her anger at Keo's strength the only thing holding her upright.

---

The savanna heat finally broke, giving way to the oppressive, humid shade of a dense jungle. For Teva, the shade was a desperate relief.

For Benal, it was a new coffin.

He hated the suit. The flexible cowl blocked his peripheral vision, forcing him to look straight ahead. His hearing, his primary defense, was rendered useless. It was drowned out by the suit's own systems—a stream of proximity pings and the hiss of the sensor package, which told him something was near, but not what or where.

Keo had led them onto a narrow game trail. Teva hated it—trails were ambush points—but the surrounding jungle was an impenetrable tangle of roots and thorns. This was the only path.

The jungle was a green-black wall, and the noise was deafening. Benal, functionally blind and deaf, walked with his hand on Keo's pack, his nerves screaming.

Noli, trotting ahead, stopped. She let out a low hiss.

"What?" Keo said.

Benal felt it an instant later. A vibration through his boots that was wrong. It wasn't a footfall. It was a slide.

A gray-green coil, thick as Benal's own body, unspooled from the leaf litter. It struck like a piston, hitting him in the chest. The impact knocked him from his feet, his breath exploding in a sharp wheeze.

Madtsoiidae.

Paralysis seized him. He couldn't scream. He couldn't move. The snake was on him, wrapping, a crushing weight that was inevitable. He felt the suit's plating groan. An alarm flashed, a red icon of a fracturing plate.

CRUSHING PRESSURE DETECTED.

"Benal!" Keo's voice was a roar.

Benal, pinned, saw Keo lunge, his fire-hardened spear driving forward. The sharpened wooden point hit the snake's scaled hide and skidded, glancing off with a dull thud. It hadn't penetrated.

The snake's reply was to squeeze.

Benal's vision tunneled. The pressure was absolute. He was going to be crushed inside his own armor.

"The head!" Teva screamed. She was already moving, her obsidian knife in her hand. She dodged the thrashing tail and scrambled onto the creature's back.

The snake, sensing her, began to turn its massive head, its black eye locking on her.

"Hold it! Keo, the head!" Teva yelled.

Keo, his spear useless, did the only thing he could. He threw himself at the snake's head, grabbing it with both hands, trying to pin it. It was like wrestling a tree trunk.

The distraction was enough. Teva, balanced on the coiling muscle, drove the stone blade down with all her weight, aiming for the eye.

She missed. The blade hit the heavy bone of the socket and the obsidian tip shattered.

The snake roared—a deep, wet hiss—and thrashed, a spasm of pure violence. It threw Teva clear. She hit a tree and crumpled.

Keo lost his grip and was thrown back. The snake, enraged, its eye a ruined, bloody mess, turned on him.

It was Benal who moved.

His paralysis broke. He wasn't a warrior, but he saw the snake's focus shift. He saw Keo vulnerable. He saw Teva unmoving.

He jammed his foot against a root and, with the last of his air, heaved himself and the snake's coils sideways. It was just half a meter, but it was enough. The snake's lunge was thrown off-balance.

Keo scrambled back, grabbing his spear. But the snake was no longer attacking. It was blinded, wounded, and enraged. It uncoiled from Benal, thrashing, destroying the undergrowth.

Teva was on her feet, her arm at a bad angle. "It's not dead! Move! Benal, run!"

Keo grabbed Benal's arm and hauled him up. The three of them fled, crashing through the jungle, leaving the wounded, hissing monster to its rage.

They didn't stop until they burst, gasping, from the treeline and stopped dead.

---

The river.

It was a churning, brown expanse, three hundred meters across at its narrowest, smelling of silt and decay.

Benal made a low sound, a choked gasp that crackled over the suit's comms. Keo came to Teva's side, Noli pressing against his leg.

"Water is death," Keo said, his voice grim.

Teva's heart hammered. Her drill, her anger, all of it felt childish against this reality. This was a liquid wall of crocs.

She looked at Benal, who was staring at his damaged suit display. The crackled screen was flashing a new, persistent warning.

JOINT SEAL COMPROMISED: LEFT ELBOW. INTEGRITY AT 40%.

His shame was a suffocating weight. He had frozen. And his suit was broken.

Teva's mind raced. They were trapped. The wounded snake was behind them. The river was in front of them.

"We don't camp," she said, her voice hollow. "We can't. We cross. Now."

"Teva..." Keo started.

"It's the only way. Benal, that seal won't hold, but it's all we have. Keo. The distraction. You said you could do it. Do it now."

"What are you thinking?" Benal asked, his voice trembling.

"I'll find one." Keo touched his temple, his face pale with exhaustion from the savanna and the fight. He closed his eyes.

Teva waited. The river was flat, brown, and silent.

A minute passed. Keo's muscles corded with a terrifying effort. But nothing happened.

"Is it... is he doing anything?" Benal whispered over the comm.

"Shut up," Teva breathed.

Keo's fists clenched. A line of sweat ran from his hairline. He looked like he was trying to lift a mountain. Still, nothing. Teva's doubt surged. This was it. They were going to die here—

A low grunt escaped Keo's throat.

A distant crash echoed from the jungle upstream.

Keo's eyes snapped open. He stumbled, catching himself on his spear. "It's running," he gasped, his voice strained.

Teva felt it through her boots. A rhythmic thump-thump-thump that was growing faster.

"Get ready!" she yelled.

A massive, duck-billed hadrosaur burst from the palms, a hundred meters downstream. Its eyes were white with a frantic, mindless terror. It didn't slow. It hit the river in a colossal explosion of spray and noise.

"NOW!" Teva screamed. She grabbed Benal's arm and plunged in.

The cool water was a shock. Her suit, which had been cooking her moments before, blared a THERMAL SHOCK warning. Benal's alarm joined it, a high-pitched SEAL FAILURE whine as water forced its way into his damaged elbow.

Water is death. Water is death. The mantra screamed in her head.

She ignored it. She kicked, hauling Benal, swimming with a desperate, clumsy power. The current was a living thing, trying to drag her downstream toward the hadrosaur.

The sounds of the fight were muffled but immense—deep splashes and the panicked bellows of the trapped animal.

Halfway. Her arms burned. Benal was a dead weight.

A shadow, larger than a skiff, moved beneath her.

Teva's breath seized. She froze.

Something hard and scaled thumped against her boot. It wasn't a bite. It was a curious nudge. A Deinosuchus, drawn by the larger prey.

She kicked, a frantic spasm, shoving Benal. Don't panic. Don't splash.

The hadrosaur's bellows were cut off. The sound was obscene—a wet, percussive crunch that she felt through the water as much as heard.

The distraction was gone.

A new, cold panic flooded her. The water, which had been focused on one target, was now a boiling soup of predators.

"KICK!" she screamed at Benal, her voice tearing.

She saw Keo just ahead, Noli's claws hooked into his pack, his spear in his teeth. He was clawing his way up the bank.

Teva put her head down and swam, her terror a fuel. Twenty meters. Ten.

The bank was slick earth and tangled roots. She hit it, her fingers sinking into the bank. She hauled, scrambling, and dragged Benal up beside her.

Keo was already there, collapsed on the ground, his body shaking from the mental exertion.

Teva rolled onto her back, gasping, her alarms still screaming from inside her cowl. Behind them, the river's surface was a chaos of fins and thrashing.

They were across.
