[ARCHIVAL FRAGMENT: 002-A]

[Declassified Internal Memo: Joint Command] — All conventional research has failed. The Temporal Project is now our only viable path. The Chicxulub Solution is authorized. We go back to find an answer. We go back to save ourselves. Mission briefing 0800.

Four days. The savanna was endless. The sun was a hammer.

Keo felt reborn.

After the claustrophobic, green-black gloom of the jungle, the open air was his element. The grief for his betrayal was a cold knot in his gut, but here, he was in control.

His upgrades hummed. His skin, exposed to the air, regulated his temperature perfectly. His enhanced metabolism burned energy with clean efficiency. He felt strong. He felt fast. He glanced back at Teva and Benal, lumbering in their heavy, mud-caked suits.

They looked slow. Vulnerable.

See? he thought, a spike of bitter pride. This is why I didn't take one. He was unburdened. He was the protector. His hubris, which had felt thin at the repository, now felt like armor.

"Stay close," he called back, his voice crisp. "I'll watch the ridges."

Teva hated him.

She hated his easy stride. She hated the sun. Most of all, she hated the suit.

It was supposed to help her. Her body’s own thermal regulation was poor, and the suit was her lifeline. But in this relentless, open heat, the suit was failing.

The thermal management system was losing. Heat built up inside the sealed fabric faster than the phase-change materials could handle it.

She was cooking.

Her head swam. The world had a shimmering, watery edge. Keo, a dozen paces ahead, was just a dark shape.

"Keo..." she tried to say, but her tongue was thick.

He looked back, his impatience obvious. "What? Keep up, Teva!"

She nodded, pushing down the dizziness. She couldn't be weak. Not after her suit had performed so well in the first days. She was the navigator.

She focused on her internal compass. Southeast. One foot. Then the next.

The suit's internal display flashed a red warning. Heat alert. Seek shade. Reduce core temp.

She was dizzy, near collapse, but she locked her knees and kept walking, her anger at Keo's strength the only thing holding her upright.

The savanna heat finally broke, giving way to the oppressive, humid shade of a dense jungle. For Teva, the shade was a desperate relief.

For Benal, it was a new coffin.

He hated the suit. The flexible cowl blocked his peripheral vision, forcing him to look straight ahead. His hearing, his primary defense, was rendered useless. It was drowned out by the suit's own systems—a stream of proximity pings and the hiss of the sensor package, which told him something was near, but not what or where.

Keo had led them onto a narrow game trail. Teva hated it—trails were ambush points—but the surrounding jungle was an impenetrable tangle of roots and thorns. This was the only path.

The jungle was a green-black wall, and the noise was deafening. Benal, functionally blind and deaf, walked with his hand on Keo's pack, his nerves screaming.

Noli, trotting ahead, stopped. She let out a low hiss.

"What?" Keo said.

Benal felt it an instant later. A vibration through his boots that was wrong. It wasn't a footfall. It was a slide.

A gray-green coil, thick as Benal's own body, unspooled from the leaf litter. It struck like a piston, hitting him in the chest. The impact knocked him from his feet, his breath exploding in a sharp wheeze.

Madtsoiidae.

Paralysis seized him. He couldn't scream. He couldn't move. The snake was on him, wrapping, a crushing weight that was inevitable. He felt the suit's plating groan. An alarm flashed, a red icon of a fracturing plate.

CRUSHING PRESSURE DETECTED.

"Benal!" Keo's voice was a roar.

Benal, pinned, saw Keo lunge, his fire-hardened spear driving forward. The sharpened wooden point hit the snake's scaled hide and skidded, glancing off with a dull thud. It hadn't penetrated.

The snake's reply was to squeeze.

Benal's vision tunneled. The pressure was absolute. He was going to be crushed inside his own armor.

"The head!" Teva screamed. She was already moving, her obsidian knife in her hand. She dodged the thrashing tail and scrambled onto the creature's back.

The snake, sensing her, began to turn its massive head, its black eye locking on her.

"Hold it! Keo, the head!" Teva yelled.

Keo, his spear useless, did the only thing he could. He threw himself at the snake's head, grabbing it with both hands, trying to pin it. It was like wrestling a tree trunk.

The distraction was enough. Teva, balanced on the coiling muscle, drove the stone blade down with all her weight, aiming for the eye.

She missed. The blade hit the heavy bone of the socket and the obsidian tip shattered.

The snake roared—a deep, wet hiss—and thrashed, a spasm of pure violence. It threw Teva clear. She hit a tree and crumpled.

Keo lost his grip and was thrown back. The snake, enraged, its eye a ruined, bloody mess, turned on him.

It was Benal who moved.

His paralysis broke. He wasn't a warrior, but he saw the snake's focus shift. He saw Keo vulnerable. He saw Teva unmoving.

He jammed his foot against a root and, with the last of his air, heaved himself and the snake's coils sideways. It was just half a meter, but it was enough. The snake's lunge was thrown off-balance.

Keo scrambled back, grabbing his spear. But the snake was no longer attacking. It was blinded, wounded, and enraged. It uncoiled from Benal, thrashing, destroying the undergrowth.

Teva was on her feet, her arm at a bad angle. "It's not dead! Move! Benal, run!"

Keo grabbed Benal's arm and hauled him up. The three of them fled, crashing through the jungle, leaving the wounded, hissing monster to its rage.

They didn't stop until they burst, gasping, from the treeline and stopped dead.
