The river.

It was a churning, brown expanse, three hundred meters across at its narrowest, smelling of silt and decay.

Benal made a low sound, a choked gasp that crackled over the suit's comms. Keo came to Teva's side, Noli pressing against his leg.

"Water is death," Keo said, his voice grim.

Teva's heart hammered. Her drill, her anger, all of it felt childish against this reality. This was a liquid wall of crocs.

She looked at Benal, who was staring at his damaged suit display. The crackled screen was flashing a new, persistent warning.

JOINT SEAL COMPROMISED: LEFT ELBOW. INTEGRITY AT 40%.

His shame was a suffocating weight. He had frozen. And his suit was broken.

Teva's mind raced. They were trapped. The wounded snake was behind them. The river was in front of them.

"We don't camp," she said, her voice hollow. "We can't. We cross. Now."

"Teva..." Keo started.

"It's the only way. Benal, that seal won't hold, but it's all we have. Keo. The distraction. You said you could do it. Do it now."

"What are you thinking?" Benal asked, his voice trembling.

"I'll find one." Keo touched his temple, his face pale with exhaustion from the savanna and the fight. He closed his eyes.

Teva waited. The river was flat, brown, and silent.

A minute passed. Keo's muscles corded with a terrifying effort. But nothing happened.

"Is it... is he doing anything?" Benal whispered over the comm.

"Shut up," Teva breathed.

Keo's fists clenched. A line of sweat ran from his hairline. He looked like he was trying to lift a mountain. Still, nothing. Teva's doubt surged. This was it. They were going to die here—

A low grunt escaped Keo's throat.

A distant crash echoed from the jungle upstream.

Keo's eyes snapped open. He stumbled, catching himself on his spear. "It's running," he gasped, his voice strained.

Teva felt it through her boots. A rhythmic thump-thump-thump that was growing faster.

"Get ready!" she yelled.

A massive, duck-billed hadrosaur burst from the palms, a hundred meters downstream. Its eyes were white with a frantic, mindless terror. It didn't slow. It hit the river in a colossal explosion of spray and noise.

"NOW!" Teva screamed. She grabbed Benal's arm and plunged in.

The cool water was a shock. Her suit, which had been cooking her moments before, blared a THERMAL SHOCK warning. Benal's alarm joined it, a high-pitched SEAL FAILURE whine as water forced its way into his damaged elbow.

Water is death. Water is death. The mantra screamed in her head.

She ignored it. She kicked, hauling Benal, swimming with a desperate, clumsy power. The current was a living thing, trying to drag her downstream toward the hadrosaur.

The sounds of the fight were muffled but immense—deep splashes and the panicked bellows of the trapped animal.

Halfway. Her arms burned. Benal was a dead weight.

A shadow, larger than a skiff, moved beneath her.

Teva's breath seized. She froze.

Something hard and scaled thumped against her boot. It wasn't a bite. It was a curious nudge. A Deinosuchus, drawn by the larger prey.

She kicked, a frantic spasm, shoving Benal. Don't panic. Don't splash.

The hadrosaur's bellows were cut off. The sound was obscene—a wet, percussive crunch that she felt through the water as much as heard.

The distraction was gone.

A new, cold panic flooded her. The water, which had been focused on one target, was now a boiling soup of predators.

"KICK!" she screamed at Benal, her voice tearing.

She saw Keo just ahead, Noli's claws hooked into his pack, his spear in his teeth. He was clawing his way up the bank.

Teva put her head down and swam, her terror a fuel. Twenty meters. Ten.

The bank was slick earth and tangled roots. She hit it, her fingers sinking into the bank. She hauled, scrambling, and dragged Benal up beside her.

Keo was already there, collapsed on the ground, his body shaking from the mental exertion.

Teva rolled onto her back, gasping, her alarms still screaming from inside her cowl. Behind them, the river's surface was a chaos of fins and thrashing.

They were across.
