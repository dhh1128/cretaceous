## 2.1
The heat of the new day pressed against Keo’s skin. It was not yet 0800. He stood at the northern barrier-tangle, a rampart of felled monkey-puzzle trees, limestone boulders, and cultivated thorny vines that formed the Enclave’s edge. The air, a humid weight, carried the acrid-sweet scent of processed cycad mash from the village core, overlaid with the green stew of the understory.

A whine sounded at his hip. Noli, his dromaeosaurus, was not pacing. She was scraping her sickle-claws on a flat stone, her body coiled to bolt. Her pebbled skin, visible beneath downy, mud-brown feathers, spasmed.

"I know," Keo muttered. He was already pushing back, a sheath of calm against her mind. It was like holding a boulder on a hilltop, and the pressure was making sweat drip into his eye. "Hold. Just... hold."

He tapped the ceramic nozzle embedded in the barrier-tangle. A smear of amber synthesis oozed onto the deadwood. The pheromone barrier.

Noli’s panic redoubled. To her, the smell was not just wrong; it was a scream. The synthesis wasn't a "stay away" sign. It was a sophisticated bio-weapon. Keo's precision-upgraded senses could parse the compounds: the base note was the musk of a dominant, territorial tyrannosaurus, but it was overlaid with the exact chemical markers of sepsis and necrotic tissue.

To a T. rex, the message was: The alpha in this territory is wounded, sick, and unpredictable. It was a signal for a risky fight, a warning to stay clear.

But to Noli—and to the razortail packs she was related to—the message was more basic and terrifying: The apex predator is here, it is wounded, and it is angry. Flee or die.

And Keo was forcing her to stand ten meters from it.

"Alright," he whispered, wiping the sweat from his brow. The word was for himself. He needed to partition his mind. One part, a dense, unthinking mental weight, to pin down Noli’s screaming instincts. The other part, focused, to search.

He closed his eyes, filtering the world. He shut out the Enclave at his back, a knotted web of nine hundred forty-one minds, thrumming with a unified frequency of fear. He pushed past the barrier-tangle.

His sense of smell sorted the air. Terpenes from the emergent conifers, geosmin from the earth, and... there. Faint trace of ammonia and musky ketones. A grounder, one of the furry multituberculates, hiding in its burrow about fifty meters out.

He formed the image in his mind: the scent, the shape, the idea of the grounder. He pushed the image, a focused thread of mental projection, through the "wall" of his own calm command and into Noli's brain. Find.

Noli’s head snapped up, her body still quivering. Her yellow eye, slitted, fixed on the jungle. She was still fighting him, her mind a storm of Flee-Danger-Flee, but the Hunt-Prey-Find signal was sharper, a focal point in the terror. She lowered into a stalk, her panic channeled into a hyper-aware predatory state. She slipped through a gap in the barrier-tangle.

Keo followed, his bare feet sinking into the earth. He moved, his own proprioception upgrade making him a ghost in the ferns. He could feel the grounder’s tiny spark of life.

Noli froze, her tail rigid for balance.

Hold.

Keo pushed the command, a spike of pure order that punched through his own mental dam. Noli’s muscles locked. Her sickle-claw, raised for the killing strike, quivered. The grounder, oblivious, rustled in the leaf litter. The instinct to kill and the instinct to flee were now at war in Noli's mind, a firestorm, and Keo’s will was the iron box containing it. The pressure behind his eyes was crushing.

Noli let out a sound of frustrated panic, a closed-throat whine.

"Good." Keo let his breath out. He let it all go—the Hold command, the blanket of calm, the partition in his mind.

The pressure popped, leaving a pounding ache behind his eyes. He staggered a step as Noli, released, lunged with a shriek. The grounder’s spark vanished.

Keo leaned against a tree, his legs shaking. He didn't feel pride. He felt exhausted. The drill was a success. The control was total.

It changed nothing.

The silence from the village core was louder than the jungle's wall of sound. Yesterday, that wall had been punctuated by a thin, rattling wail. Then, silence.

He’d felt it, even from here. A thin snap in the mental web of the Enclave. He hadn't needed to see the body. The yazhi, Alira. Gone. Her bright thread, extinguished by a minor infection. An infection the baseline immune upgrades should have crushed.

But Alira, born three weeks ago, had been too late. The last vial of the Seeding vector, the one that triggered the immune enhancement, had failed. The kiva’s cultures were dimming.

Keo raked a hand over his face. He’d seen the adults yesterday. Wilted. That was the only word for it. Rano and the other journeyman Keepers, their faces slack. Elana, Alira's mother, rocking. Even the Council members, lost in their own fear.

The thought soured in his stomach. His obsessive drill, his control over Noli—it was a distraction. A desperate attempt to prove that he, at least, was not helpless.

Noli trotted back, licking her chops, and nudged his hand. She was calm now, the toxic smell of the barrier already forgotten in the wake of a successful hunt. He stroked her snout, the hard scales cool beneath his palm.

"It's fine," he whispered. It was a lie, and the sound of it was brittle in the humid air. "The Keepers will fix it. Omya will remember. They'll fix it."

He needed to believe it. He was strong. He was fast. His upgrades had all taken, full-expression. He was not a yazhi. He was not fragile. And he would not be paralyzed.

"Go on," he told Noli, giving her a light shove. "Hunt for real."

She looked at him, then bounded away into the ferns, a mud-and-leaf blur, leaving him alone.

Keo turned to face the Enclave. He squared his shoulders, forcing a confidence he didn't feel into his posture. He was Keo, son of Explorers. He was not afraid. He was not grieving. He was just... going back to his chores.

He began the walk back to the village core, his every step a performance of normalcy.

## 2.2

Benal’s knees poked from under the slate he held in his lap, pushing into a weave of living vines that comprised one wall of his sleeping area. He was very tall—190 centimeters—and this space was cramped.

A breeze swayed the trees, sending a creak through the floor. He leaned without noticing, a habit common to every inhabitant of Enclave. They all lived in nests like this—multi-room platforms taut-slung between towering conifers, fifteen meters above the reach of any predator. Overhead, a pterosaur screamed. Benal flinched slightly, but did not look up at the thatched roof that hid him from its gaze.

He erased a line of chalk symbols with his thumb, smearing the slate.

$T_d = T_o \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \cdot (f_{drift}?)$

The equation stared back, mocking him. It was supposed to be the anchor, the fixed point. But it drifted. The original mission logs were clear: the scientists had a solution for temporal anchoring. But the transit had corrupted the data, and 206 years of interpretation had turned their science into ritual.

"It's not the origin," he muttered, his voice sounding reedy in the resin-scented air. "The origin is a fixed event. Chicxulub. $T_o$."

His frustration knotted inside him. The problem, he was sure, was in the destination. The Traditionalists and the Council—they all assumed time was a river you could step into and out of. They were wrong. It was a current, and the current itself was moving.

"They didn't account for cosmic expansion," he whispered to the slate. "They anchored to a point in space, not a point in spacetime. The anchor is... unmoored."

He picked up the chalk, his lanky fingers stained white. He added a new variable, a symbol for the "signal decay," the "asymptotic noise" that riddled every calculation he ran. It was useless. He was guessing.

His hearing, always too sharp, pulled the outside world in, flooding his refuge. His superior auditory upgrade wasn't a gift; it was a burden, an unfiltered assault.

He tried to focus on the slate, but the world wouldn't let him.

Distant: Bass thumps, more feeling than sound. Saropo. A herd, moving miles to the south.

Mid-ground: The wet glump... glump... glump of the cycad processing pit. The high, shrieking laughter of yazhi in the canopy-walks.

Close: A sound on the roof. Scrabble-click. Scrabble-click. A flybeak, its claws testing the roof-thatch for weak points. He didn't flinch, just grabbed a stick from his side and thumped it against the central trunk. THUMP. A squawk of protest, the beat of leathery wings, and it was gone.

And then, the sounds that mattered.

Three nests over, Elana, Alira's mother, was still whimpering. She'd wailed yesterday, and last night. Sometimes she still did. But maybe the whimpering was worse.

It made his teeth ache.

Below, from way out by the perimeter, a two-note whistle. Keo.

Benal’s shoulders tensed. Keo’s whistle was piercing, full of a confidence that Benal lacked. It was the sound of someone who knew how to use their body, someone who "did something real." It was probably the whistle for Noli, his odd pet dromaeosaurus. The sound of a friend calling his companion.

Benal looked at his slate. He had only equations, and they were all liars.

A new sound, right outside his privacy screen of ferns. The footfalls were measured and resigned. Smells hit his senstive nose a moment later—piñones, human sweat, and the faint, coppery tang of carne from the morning meal.

The ferns swished. Marek stood there, his father, a broad man who blocked the light. Marek was a Brancher, a man who believed in the physical world. He looked at the slate in Benal's lap, then at Benal, and his expression settled into the one Benal dreaded.

Not anger. Not disappointment.

Pity.

"Still staring at those dead symbols, son?" His voice was not unkind.

Benal’s shoulders hunched. He couldn't meet his father's eyes. "They're not dead. It's the anchor equation. I think I—"

"Benal." Marek sighed. It was like wind leaving a cave. "Alira died. Elana is... she's not right. The kiva is failing. The kiva, Benal. Our upgrades."

"I know," Benal said, his voice tight.

"Do you?" Marek put a calloused hand on Benal’s shoulder. Benal fought the urge to flinch. "This..." Marek waved his other hand at the slate, at the precise lines of temporal mechanics. "...this isn't real."

"It is real!" Benal’s voice cracked. "It's the mission. It's why we're here. We have to solve the temporal mechanics to send the solution—"

"There is no mission," Marek said. "That's a story the first generation told to keep from going mad. A noble lie. We’re here. This is it. Our timeline branched. Nothing we do affects a future that isn't ours."

He squeezed Benal's shoulder. "The only thing that matters is surviving here. Today. This... this math." He shook his head. "It won't feed the cultures. It won't stop a croc from taking a yazhi at the river. It's a game. A child's game."

Benal stared at the floor. He felt a hot prickle of shame rise in his throat.

"Go help Rano," Marek said. "They're reinforcing the perimeter. Shift some stone. Carry some water. Do something real."

He didn't wait for an answer. He squeezed Benal's shoulder once more, a gesture of helpless and frustrated love, and then retreated through the ferns to a far corner of the nest.

Do something real.

Benal’s gaze dropped to his own hands. Stained with chalk, not dirt. Good for symbols. Useless for stone.

He sat there for a long time, the sounds of the Enclave washing over him—the thud of the processors, the distant saropo, the muffle of Elana's grief. They were the sounds of the real world. A world that saw him as failed upgrades and freakish, useless height.

His father was wrong. He had to be. The mission was real because... because if it wasn't, then what was he?

His hand, trembling, picked up the chalk. He looked at the slate, at the maddening equation.

$T_d = T_o \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \cdot (f_{drift}?)$

His frustration was a shard in his chest.

"The anchor must be wrong," he whispered, and drew the line again.

## 2.3

Teva’s eyes burned. She hadn't slept. She’d pulled her hair back under a wide-brimmed woven hat, but it felt useless. The sun didn't just press; it hammered her shoulders through her thin tunic. Heat radiated from the packed earth, crawling up her legs. Sweat didn't cool her; it clung, a hot plaster holding the fabric to her skin. The air was thick with the thrum of insects.

"Again."

Her voice was toneless, lost in the noise of the village. Six tense yazhi stood on a line scratched in the dust. The village center smelled of clay, fermenting pith, and sweat.

She pointed to the Yazhi Pool—a fenced-in eddy of the Enclave creek, shallow and murky. "The bank. Go."

Their bare feet squelched as they shuffled forward. They dipped their gourds. Backed away from the pool, eyes locked on the murk.

"Eyes on the water," Teva commanded anyway. Her voice sounded brittle.

Joss, a stocky boy of four, nudged Miri, the girl beside him. "Bet I can hit the far stick." He scooped a pebble and, with a flick of his wrist, tossed it.

It plopped near the center of the pool.

Teva moved faster than the yazhi had ever seen. She crossed the five meters in two strides and seized Joss by the arm. Her grip made the boy yelp. She hauled him up to her eye level.

"What did I say?" Her voice was a shaking whisper that terrified the children more than a shout.

"N-not to..." Joss stammered.

"A Deinosuchus," Teva said, her voice dropping into the precise, "precision" language of the Keepers, "can detect a four-micrometer vibration through its integumentary sensors. It can feel your heartbeat through the mud. That plop? That's a dinner bell."

"You think we only come here when the rain cisterns run dry? We come here for carne. We come here to check the fish traps. We come here to fix this palisade. The river is always waiting."

She dropped him. He sat hard in the mud, tears welling.

"You don't just get yourself killed," she hissed, jabbing a finger at Miri, who was frozen. "You get your buddy killed. Is that what you want? You want Miri to be carne?"

"It's hot," Joss whined from the mud.

Teva’s patience snapped. The boy’s skin, like most of the others, was barely damp—his thermal seeding had expressed perfectly. Her own tunic was soaked, her skin an itchy misery. A dizzying pressure built behind her eyes. This was her weakness, the one that had failed to take.

"Do it again."

She was about to force them back to the line when the world changed.

The thrum of insects ceased, and a gust of wind, smelling of ozone and wet dust, swept through the clearing. The sky, a brassy white moments before, was now a bruised gray.

Then the rain came.

It wasn't a drizzle; it was a deluge. A lashing, warm rain that hit the packed earth with a roar, turning the clay to instant mud.

"Shelter!" Teva barked.

The yazhi scattered, yelping as the first fat drops hit them. They scrambled under a fern-thatch awning, huddling together as the roof immediately began to leak, streaming water onto their heads.

Teva didn't move. She stood in the open, tilting her head back and shutting her eyes.

The rain hammered her, plastering her hair to her skull in seconds, sluicing the sweat and grime from her skin. It was a shock, but it was a relief. The dizzying pressure behind her eyes began to ease, the suffocating heat finally broken.

Her gaze lifted, sweeping the village through the gray sheet of the downpour. It wasn't paralyzed; it was frantic. Across the clearing, the hadrosaur, guided by its handlers, merely shifted its weight, glistening. The older teens had dashed under a dwelling platform, their laughter still braying, their flirtation just... damp. On the perimeter, the silhouette of a watcher was a statue in the wet.

It was all noise. A performance. They were all acting out their parts—the strong worker, the careless teen, the vigilant scout—while the kiva's cultures flickered. While her grandmother...

The rain turned the Yazhi Pool into an overflowing soup of mud. She looked from it to the distant, silver-green of the real river, now obscured by the storm. The real crocs. This drill was a prayer to a dead god.

A croc hadn't killed Alira. A croc hadn't killed her mother. A stingburn had. The plague.

She looked back at the children, huddled and dripping under the leaking thatch. Her fear. She was teaching them the wrong lesson. The monsters weren't just in the water. They were in the blood.

"Done!" she shouted over the roar of the rain. "Go!"

The yazhi scattered, relief in every step as they dashed through the puddles toward their homes.

Teva stood alone, the exhaustion and hollowness giving way to the sharp clarity the storm had brought her. The drills were useless. The Council, huddled in their kiva, was useless.

She knew what she had to do. Go to Genesis. Find the protocols.

But the mudwalk was eighty kilometers of predator-haunted swamp and savanna. Alone, it was suicide.

Her rage was fuel, but it wasn't a spear. She needed skills. She needed... allies.

Keo.

His name formed in her mind. Her friend. He was brash, cocky, a show-off... probably masking fear with bravado. But he was also one of the few who could push his in... he was loyal. He would not hesitate.

And Benal.

The second name was a surprise. Benal was fragile. He'd panic at the first croc-slog. But Genesis was old-tech. Her magnetic sense could get them there, Keo's strength could protect them, but what if they found it and couldn't understand it?

Benal’s intricate equations... his chalk-markings... they might be the only key that fit the lock.

The plan clicked.

She wouldn't just act. She would recruit.
