Keo stood by the northern palisade. The perfume of flowers and the tang of cycad mulch pressed hot and wet. Beyond the logs, the jungle formed a wall of noise.

He tuned it out. He focused on the creature at his feet.

Noli’s feathers ruffled, her head-crest flattening as she tasted the air. The pheromone barrier.

Keo smelled its musky trace, too. But his senses pushed further. He tasted the dust of a ceratops herd kilometers off and detected the thunder steps of a lone saropo far to the west. He didn't need Noli to be his eyes and ears. He just needed her to listen.

Still, he thought.

He didn't speak. He pushed the command. A simple spike of intent, a thread of mental projection that felt like flexing a muscle behind his eyes.

Noli’s head snapped toward him. Her yellow eye, round and sharp as a flybeak's, held his. The instinct to bolt, to hunt, to flee—it was all there, coiled under the feathers. But his will was a cold, smooth stone in her mind.

Sit.

She fought it for a second. Her sickle-claw twitched. Then, with a bird-like huff, she lowered her haunches.

Keo let out his breath. "Good."

The word was for him, not for her. The silence from the village core was louder than the jungle. All morning, no one had met his eyes. The adults wilted, their heads down.

Paralysis. The thought soured in his stomach.

Alira’s death. The kiva’s dimming lights. The fear. It clung to the Safe Zone like mud.

Keo scrubbed a hand over his face. He whistled, a two-note sound. Noli sprang up.

"It's fine," he whispered, more to himself than the dromaeosaur. He needed to do something, not brood. "Everything will be fine. The Keepers will fix it."

He believed it. Mostly.

He gave Noli a shove. "Go on. Hunt."

He pushed the release command, severing the link. The pressure behind his eyes vanished. Noli shook, as if waking up, and vanished into the groves, a feathered blur.

Keo turned his back on the perimeter. He was strong. He was fast. He wasn't afraid. He would not be paralyzed.

Benal’s knee jammed against the dwelling's central support trunk. He'd outgrown the space again, a tangle of limbs folded onto a low stool. He erased a line of symbols with his thumb, smearing the slate.

The equation stared back, mocking him. It was an anchor, a fixed point, but it drifted.

His hearing, always too sharp, pulled the outside world in. Three dwellings over, a yazhi fussed. Far below, at the perimeter, Keo’s sharp, two-note whistle for Noli. And, just outside the privacy screen, his father’s approach.

The footfalls were heavy, resigned.

The screen rattled aside. Tavan stood there, a broad man who filled the doorway. He smelled of cycad mulch and sweat. His gaze went from the slate to Benal, and his expression settled. Not anger. Pity.

"Still staring at those dead symbols, son?"

Benal’s jaw tightened. "They're not dead. It's the anchor equation."

Tavan sighed. The sound was a low gust, like wind leaving a cave. "Alira died, Benal. The kiva is failing. This..." He waved a thick hand at the slate. "...this won't feed the cultures. Go help Rano. Shift some stone. Do something real."

He didn't wait for an answer. The screen rattled shut.

Do something real.

Benal’s gaze dropped to his own hands. Long, thin fingers, stained with chalk, not dirt. Good for symbols.

Useless for stone.

He picked up the chalk. The dwelling felt smaller, the walls pressing in. His own frustration was a cold, familiar weight in his chest.

Teva’s eyes burned. She hadn't slept. The sun pressed on her bare shoulders, and the air was thick with the thrum of insects.

"Again."

Her voice was flat, lost in the noise of the village. A half-dozen tense yazhi stood on a scratched line. The village center smelled of clay, fermenting pith, and sweat.

She pointed to the muddy practice trough. "The bank. Go."

Their bare feet made squelching sounds as they shuffled forward. They dipped their gourds. Backed away from the trough, eyes locked on the murk.

"Eyes on the water," Teva commanded anyway. Her voice felt hollow.

A girl, maybe four, tripped on her own feet and sat hard. A startled giggle escaped her.

Teva’s lips pursed. She hauled the girl up, her grip too tight. The giggle died. "A croc doesn't care if you're clumsy."

"It's hot," a small boy whined.

"Do it again."

She drilled them again. And again. Forward. Dip. Back away. Never turn.

Her gaze lifted, sweeping the village. It wasn't paralyzed; it was frantically busy. Across the clearing, a hadrosaur, guided by two handlers, strained against a harness, dragging a massive tree trunk. Near the central dwelling, two older teens were refilling water skins, laughing too loudly, their flirtation obvious and stupid. On the perimeter, the silhouette of a watcher moved along the log wall.

It was all noise. A performance. They were all acting out their parts—the strong worker, the careless teen, the vigilant scout—while the kiva's cultures flickered out. While her grandmother...

She looked from the children's muddy trough, so shallow it wouldn't wet their knees, to the distant, silver-green glimpse of the real river. The real crocs. This drill was a prayer to a dead god.

A croc hadn't killed Alira. A croc hadn't killed her mother. A simple stingburn had. The plague.

She looked back at the children. Their faces were streaked with mud and sweat. Her fear. She was teaching them the wrong lesson. The monsters weren't just in the water. They were in the blood.

She clapped her hands. The sound cracked. "Done. Go."

The yazhi scattered, relief in every small step.

Teva stood alone, the exhaustion and the hollow feeling giving way to a chilling pragmatism. The drills were useless. The Council, huddled in their kiva, was useless.

She knew what she had to do. Go to the Genesis Site. Find the protocols.

But the mudwalk was eighty kilometers of predator-filled swamp and savanna. Alone, it was suicide.

Her rage was fuel, but it wasn't a spear. She needed skills. She needed... allies.

Keo.

His name formed in her mind. Her friend. He was brash, cocky, always showing off... maybe masking his fear with that stupid bravado. But he was also one of the few who could push his will into a razortail's mind. And he was loyal. He would not hesitate.

And Benal.

The second name was a surprise. Benal was fragile. He'd panic at the first croc-slog. But the Genesis Site was old-tech. The Archive. Her magnetic sense could get them there, Keo's strength could protect them, but what if they found it and couldn't understand it?

Benal’s strange math... his chalk-markings... they might be the only key that fit the lock.

A plan settled over her. She wouldn't just act. She would recruit.
