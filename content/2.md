Morning heat pressed against Keo. It was not yet 0800, but the sky was already bruising purple in the south, promising violence later. He manned the northern barrier-tangle, a rampart of felled monkey-puzzle trees, limestone boulders, and cultivated thorny vines that formed the Enclave’s edge. The humid air carried the acrid-sweet scent of processed cycad mash from the village core, overlaid with the green stew of the understory.

A whine sounded at his hip. Noli, his dromaeosaurus, refused to pace. She scraped her sickle-claws on a flat stone, body coiled to bolt. Pebbled skin spasmed beneath downy, mud-brown feathers.

"I know," Keo muttered. He pushed back, wrapping a sheath of calm around her mind. It felt like holding a boulder on a hilltop; the pressure squeezed sweat into his eye. "Hold. Just... hold."

He tapped the ceramic nozzle embedded in the barrier-tangle. A smear of amber synthesis oozed onto the deadwood. The pheromone barrier.

Noli’s panic redoubled. To her, the smell wasn't a "stay away" sign; it was a scream. The synthesis acted as a sophisticated bio-weapon. Keo's precision-upgraded senses parsed the compounds: the base note was the musk of a dominant, territorial tyrannosaurus, overlaid with the chemical markers of sepsis and necrotic tissue.

To a T. rex, the message was clear: The alpha in this territory is wounded, sick, and unpredictable. A signal for a risky fight. A warning to stay clear.

But to Noli—and to the razortail packs of her kin—the message was primal terror: The apex predator is here. It is wounded. It is angry. Flee or die.

And Keo forced her to stand ten meters from it.

"Alright," he whispered, wiping his brow. The word was for himself. He needed to partition his mind. One part required a dense, unthinking weight to pin down Noli’s screaming instincts. The other part needed focus to search.

He closed his eyes and filtered the world. He shut out the Enclave at his back. That knotted web of nine hundred forty-one minds thrummed with a unified frequency of fear. He pushed past the barrier-tangle.

His sense of smell sorted the air. Terpenes from the emergent conifers. Geosmin from the earth. And... there. A faint trace of ammonia and musky ketones. A grounder, one of the furry multituberculates, hid in its burrow fifty meters out.

He formed the image in his mind: the scent, the shape, the idea of the grounder. He pushed the image—a focused thread of mental projection—through the "wall" of his own command and into Noli's brain. Find.

Noli’s head snapped up. She quivered. Her yellow, slitted eye fixed on the jungle. She still fought him, her mind a storm of Flee-Danger-Flee, but the Hunt-Prey-Find signal pierced the terror. She lowered into a stalk, channeling panic into a hyper-aware predatory state. She slipped through a gap in the barrier-tangle.

Keo followed. His bare feet sank into the earth. He moved, his proprioception upgrade making him a ghost in the ferns. He felt the grounder’s tiny spark of life.

Noli froze, tail rigid for balance.

Hold.

Keo pushed the command, a spike of order that punched through his mental dam. Noli’s muscles locked. Her raised sickle-claw quivered. The oblivious grounder rustled the leaf litter. The instinct to kill and the instinct to flee warred in Noli's mind, a firestorm contained only by Keo’s will. The pressure behind his eyes crushed him.

Noli let out a sound of frustrated panic, a closed-throat whine.

"Good." Keo exhaled. He let it all go—the Hold command, the blanket of calm, the partition in his mind.

The pressure popped, leaving a pounding ache behind his eyes. He staggered as Noli lunged with a shriek. The grounder’s spark vanished.

Keo leaned against a tree. His legs shook. He didn't feel pride. He felt hollow. The drill was a success. The control was total.

It changed nothing.

The silence from the village core drowned out the jungle's wall of sound. Yesterday, a jagged tear in the Enclave's mental web had silenced the village core.

He’d felt it from here. The grief that drowned out the jungle. He hadn't needed to see the body. The yazhi, Alira, gone. Her bright thread extinguished by a minor infection. An infection the baseline immune upgrades should have crushed.

But Alira, born three weeks ago, had been too late. The last vial of the Seeding vector, the trigger for immune enhancement, had failed. The kiva’s cultures dimmed.

Keo raked a hand over his face. He’d seen the adults. Wilted. No other word fit. Rano and the other journeyman Keepers wore slack faces. Elana, Alira's mother, rocked. Even the Council members seemed lost.

The thought soured his stomach. His obsessive drill, his control over Noli—it was a distraction. A desperate attempt to prove that he, at least, was not helpless.

Noli trotted back to nudge his hand, licking her chops. The toxic smell of the barrier faded from her mind in the wake of a successful hunt. He stroked her snout, feeling the cool, hard scales.

"It's fine," he whispered. The lie sounded brittle in the humid air. "The Keepers will fix it. Omya will remember. They'll fix it."

He needed to believe it. He was strong. Fast. His upgrades had all taken, full-expression. He was not a yazhi. He was not fragile. And he would not be paralyzed.

"Go on," he told Noli, giving her a shove. "Hunt for real."

She looked at him, then bounded into the ferns. A mud-and-leaf blur, she vanished, leaving him alone.

Keo turned to the Enclave. He squared his shoulders, forcing a confidence he didn't feel. He was Keo, son of Explorers. He was not afraid. He was not grieving. He was just... going back to his chores.

He walked back to the village core, making every step a performance of normalcy.

## 2.2

Benal’s knees poked from under the slate in his lap and pushed into the living vine weave of his wall. He was very tall—190 centimeters—and this sleeping space was cramped.

A breeze swayed the trees, sending a creak through the floor. He leaned with the motion without noticing—a habit common to every inhabitant of Enclave. They all lived in these nests, multi-room platforms taut-slung between towering conifers fifteen meters above any predator’s reach. Overhead, a pterosaur screamed. Benal flinched but did not look up at the thatched roof hiding him from its gaze.

His thumb erased a line of chalk symbols, smearing the slate.

$T_d = T_o \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \cdot (f_{drift}?)$

The equation stared back and mocked him. It was supposed to be the anchor, the fixed point. But it drifted. The original mission logs were clear: the scientists had a solution for temporal anchoring. Yet the transit corrupted the data, and 206 years of interpretation had turned their science into ritual.

"It's not the origin," he muttered. His voice sounded reedy in the resin-scented air. "The origin is a fixed event. Chicxulub. $T_o$."

Frustration knotted his gut. The problem lay in the destination. The Traditionalists and the Council assumed time was a river you could step into and out of. They were wrong. It was a current, and the current itself moved.

"They didn't account for cosmic expansion," he whispered to the slate. "They anchored to a point in space, not a point in spacetime. The anchor is... unmoored."

He picked up the chalk with fingers stained white. He added a new variable: a symbol for the "signal decay," the "asymptotic noise" riddling every calculation he ran. Useless. He was guessing.

His hearing, always too sharp, pulled the outside world in and flooded his refuge. His superior auditory upgrade wasn't a gift; it was a burden, an unfiltered assault.

He tried to focus on the slate, but the world wouldn't let him.

Distant: Bass thumps, more feeling than sound. Saropo. A herd, moving miles to the south.

Mid-ground: The wet glump... glump... glump of the cycad processing pit. The shrieking laughter of yazhi in the canopy-walks.

Close: A sound on the roof. Scrabble-click. Scrabble-click. A flybeak tested the roof-thatch with its claws. He didn't flinch. He grabbed a stick from his side and thumped it against the central trunk. THUMP. A squawk of protest, the beat of leathery wings, and it was gone.

And then, the sounds that mattered.

Three nests over, Elana, Alira's mother, still whimpered. She'd wailed yesterday, and last night. Sometimes she still did. But the whimpering was worse.

It made his teeth ache.

Below, near the perimeter, a two-note whistle sounded. Keo.

Benal’s shoulders tensed. Keo’s piercing whistle brimmed with a confidence that Benal lacked. It was the sound of someone who knew how to use their body, someone who "did something real." Probably the call for Noli, his odd pet dromaeosaurus. The sound of a friend calling his companion.

Benal looked at his slate. He had only equations, and they were all liars.

A new sound scratched right outside his privacy screen of ferns. Measured, resigned footfalls. Smells hit his sensitive nose a moment later—piñones, human sweat, and the faint, coppery tang of carne from the morning meal.

The ferns swished. Marek, his father, stood there. The broad man blocked the light. He looked at the slate in Benal's lap, then at Benal. His expression settled into the one Benal dreaded.

Not anger. Not disappointment.

Pity.

"Still staring at those dead symbols, son?" His voice was not unkind.

Benal hunched. He couldn't meet his father's eyes. "They're not dead. It's the anchor equation. I think I—"

"Benal." Marek sighed. Wind leaving a cave. "Alira died. Elana is... she's not right. The kiva is failing. The kiva, Benal. Our upgrades."

"I know," Benal said, voice tight.

"Do you?" Marek put a calloused hand on Benal’s shoulder. Benal fought the urge to flinch. "This..." Marek waved his other hand at the slate and its precise lines of temporal mechanics. "...this isn't real."

"It is real!" Benal’s voice cracked. "It's the mission. It's why we're here. We have to solve the temporal mechanics to send the solution—"

"There is no mission," Marek said. "That's a story the first generation told to keep from going mad. A noble lie. We’re here. This is it. Our timeline branched. Nothing we do affects a future that isn't ours."

He squeezed Benal's shoulder. "The only thing that matters is surviving here. Today. This... this math." He shook his head. "It won't feed the cultures. It won't stop a croc from taking a yazhi at the river. It's a game. A child's game."

Benal stared at the floor. A hot prickle of shame rose in his throat.

"Go help Rano," Marek said. "They're reinforcing the perimeter. Shift some stone. Carry some water. Do something real."

He didn't wait for an answer. He squeezed Benal's shoulder once more—a gesture of helpless, frustrated love—and retreated through the ferns to a far corner of the nest.

Do something real.

Benal dropped his gaze to his hands. Stained with chalk, not dirt. Good for symbols. Useless for stone.

He sat there for a long time. The sounds of the Enclave washed over him—the thud of the processors, the distant saropo, the muffle of Elana's grief. The sounds of the real world. A world that saw him as failed upgrades and freakish, useless height.

His father was wrong. He had to be. The mission was real because... because if it wasn't, then what was he?

His trembling hand picked up the chalk. He looked at the slate, at the maddening equation.

$T_d = T_o \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \cdot (f_{drift}?)$

Frustration became a shard in his chest.

"The anchor must be wrong," he whispered, and drew the line again.

## 2.3

Teva’s eyes burned. She hadn't slept. She’d pulled her hair back under a wide-brimmed woven hat, but it felt useless. The sun didn't just press; it hammered her shoulders through her thin tunic. Heat radiated from the packed earth and crawled up her legs. Sweat didn't cool her. It clung like hot plaster, holding the fabric to her skin. The air thrummed with insects.

"Again."

Her toneless voice got lost in the village noise. Six tense yazhi stood on a line scratched in the dust. The village center smelled of clay, fermenting pith, and sweat.

She pointed to the Yazhi Pool—a fenced-in eddy of the Enclave creek, shallow and murky. "The bank. Go."

Their bare feet squelched as they shuffled forward. They dipped their gourds. They backed away from the pool, eyes locked on the murk.

"Eyes on the water," Teva commanded anyway. Her voice sounded brittle.

Joss, a stocky boy of four, nudged Miri, the girl beside him. "Bet I can hit the far stick." He scooped a pebble and, with a flick of his wrist, tossed it.

It plopped near the center of the pool.

Teva moved faster than the yazhi had ever seen. She crossed the five meters in two strides and seized Joss by the arm. Her grip made the boy yelp. She hauled him up to her eye level.

"What did I say?" Her shaking whisper terrified the children more than a shout.

"N-not to..." Joss stammered.

"A Deinosuchus," Teva said, dropping into the precise language of the Keepers, "can detect a four-micrometer vibration through its integumentary sensors. It can feel your heartbeat through the mud. That plop? That's a dinner bell."

"You think we only come here when the rain cisterns run dry? We come here for carne. We come here to check the fish traps. We come here to fix this palisade. The river is always waiting."

She dropped him. He sat hard in the mud, tears welling.

"You don't just get yourself killed," she hissed, jabbing a finger at the frozen Miri. "You get your buddy killed. Is that what you want? You want Miri to be carne?"

"It's hot," Joss whined from the mud.

Teva’s patience snapped. The boy’s skin, like most of the others, was barely damp—his thermal seeding had expressed perfectly. Her own tunic was soaked, her skin an itchy misery. A dizzying pressure built behind her eyes. This was her weakness, the one that had failed to take.

"Do it again."

She was about to force them back to the line when the world changed.

The insect thrum ceased. A gust of wind, smelling of ozone and wet dust, swept the clearing. The sky, brassy white moments before, turned bruised gray.

Then the rain came.

It wasn't a drizzle; it was a thatch-cutter. A lashing, warm rain hit the packed earth with a roar, turning clay to instant mud.

"Shelter!" Teva barked.

The yazhi scattered, yelping as the first fat drops hit them. They scrambled under a fern-thatch awning. The roof immediately leaked, streaming water onto their huddled heads.

Teva didn't move. She stood in the open, tilted her head back, and shut her eyes.

The rain hammered her. It plastered hair to her skull and sluiced sweat and grime from her skin. It was a shock, but a relief. The dizzying pressure behind her eyes began to ease, the suffocating heat finally broken.

Her gaze lifted, sweeping the village through the gray sheet of the downpour. It wasn't paralyzed; it was frantic. Across the clearing, the glistening hadrosaur merely shifted its weight under its handlers' guide. The older teens had dashed under a dwelling platform, their laughter still braying, their flirtation just... damp. On the perimeter, the silhouette of a watcher stood like a statue in the wet.

It was all noise. A performance. They acted out their parts—the strong worker, the careless teen, the vigilant scout—while the kiva's cultures flickered. While her grandmother...

The rain turned the Yazhi Pool into an overflowing soup of mud. She looked from it to the distant silver-green of the real river, now obscured by the storm. The real crocs. This drill was a prayer to a dead god.

A croc hadn't killed Alira. A croc hadn't killed her mother. A stingburn had. The plague.

She looked back at the children huddled under the leaking thatch. Her fear. She was teaching them the wrong lesson. They were staring at the murky water, terrified of teeth and claws, while a threat just as real was already coursing through their veins, invisible.

"Done!" she shouted over the roar of the rain. "Go!"

The yazhi scattered, relief in every step as they dashed through the puddles toward their homes.

Teva stood alone. Exhaustion and hollowness gave way to the sharp clarity brought by the storm. The drills were useless. The Council, huddled in their kiva, was useless.

She knew what she had to do. Go to Genesis. Find the protocols.

But the mudwalk was eighty kilometers of predator-haunted swamp and savanna. Alone, it was suicide.

Her rage was fuel, but it wasn't a spear. She needed skills. She needed... allies.

Keo.

His name formed in her mind. Her friend. He was brash, cocky, a show-off... probably masking fear with bravado. But he was also one of the few who could push his in... he was loyal. He would not hesitate.

And Benal.

The second name was a surprise. Benal was fragile. He'd panic at the first croc-slog. But Genesis was old-tech. Her magnetic sense could get them there, Keo's strength could protect them, but what if they found it and couldn't understand it?

Benal’s intricate equations... his chalk-markings... they might be the only key that fit the lock.

The plan clicked.

She wouldn't just act. She would recruit.
