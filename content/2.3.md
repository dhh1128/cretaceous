Teva’s eyes burned. She hadn't slept. The sun pressed on her bare shoulders, and the air was thick with the thrum of insects.

"Again."

Her voice was flat, lost in the noise of the village. A half-dozen tense yazhi stood on a scratched line. The village center smelled of clay, fermenting pith, and sweat.

She pointed to the muddy practice trough. "The bank. Go."

Their bare feet made squelching sounds as they shuffled forward. They dipped their gourds. Backed away from the trough, eyes locked on the murk.

"Eyes on the water," Teva commanded anyway. Her voice felt hollow.

A girl, maybe four, tripped on her own feet and sat hard. A startled giggle escaped her.

Teva’s lips pursed. She hauled the girl up, her grip too tight. The giggle died. "A croc doesn't care if you're clumsy."

"It's hot," a small boy whined.

"Do it again."

She drilled them again. And again. Forward. Dip. Back away. Never turn.

Her gaze lifted, sweeping the village. It wasn't paralyzed; it was frantically busy. Across the clearing, a hadrosaur, guided by two handlers, strained against a harness, dragging a massive tree trunk. Near the central dwelling, two older teens were refilling water skins, laughing too loudly, their flirtation obvious and stupid. On the perimeter, the silhouette of a watcher moved along the log wall.

It was all noise. A performance. They were all acting out their parts—the strong worker, the careless teen, the vigilant scout—while the kiva's cultures flickered out. While her grandmother...

She looked from the children's muddy trough, so shallow it wouldn't wet their knees, to the distant, silver-green glimpse of the real river. The real crocs. This drill was a prayer to a dead god.

A croc hadn't killed Alira. A croc hadn't killed her mother. A simple stingburn had. The plague.

She looked back at the children. Their faces were streaked with mud and sweat. Her fear. She was teaching them the wrong lesson. The monsters weren't just in the water. They were in the blood.

She clapped her hands. The sound cracked. "Done. Go."

The yazhi scattered, relief in every small step.

Teva stood alone, the exhaustion and the hollow feeling giving way to a chilling pragmatism. The drills were useless. The Council, huddled in their kiva, was useless.

She knew what she had to do. Go to the Genesis Site. Find the protocols.

But the mudwalk was eighty kilometers of predator-filled swamp and savanna. Alone, it was suicide.

Her rage was fuel, but it wasn't a spear. She needed skills. She needed... allies.

Keo.

His name formed in her mind. Her friend. He was brash, cocky, always showing off... maybe masking his fear with that stupid bravado. But he was also one of the few who could push his will into a razortail's mind. And he was loyal. He would not hesitate.

And Benal.

The second name was a surprise. Benal was fragile. He'd panic at the first croc-slog. But the Genesis Site was old-tech. The Archive. Her magnetic sense could get them there, Keo's strength could protect them, but what if they found it and couldn't understand it?

Benal’s strange math... his chalk-markings... they might be the only key that fit the lock.

A plan settled over her. She wouldn't just act. She would recruit.
