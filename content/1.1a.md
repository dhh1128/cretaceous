The colors were dying.

The stone chilled Teva’s feet as she watched the light fail. Alcoves carved into the limestone flickered, sick and muddy. They were supposed to glow—a vital blue, a sharp yellow, a green bright as glassleaf.

Now, they were just threads of survival, breaking one by one.

In the center of the chamber, Rano’s voice was a rope pulled thin. "Omya."

Teva’s grandmother sat at the stone table, gray hair plastered to her skull. She stared at the tray of colored blocks.

"The offset is one-oh-seven," Rano said. He wasn't asking. He was pleading. "You know this."

Omya’s hand, thin and spotted, hovered. Her fingers trembled. She picked up a blue block, then a yellow one, and tried to fit them together. They didn't lock. She looked up at Rano, her eyes wide. Lost.

"No." Rano’s voice cracked. He swept the blocks from the table. They clattered on the stone, a sharp, violent sound in the damp.

A lie. Teva knew it. This wasn't a test. Omya had failed this three times this week. This was a ritual, a prayer for the elders huddled in the shadows.

Teva looked away from her grandmother’s shame and to the kiva’s entrance.

A woman, Elara, was there, rocking. Huddled against the wall. The bundle in her arms was Alira. The yazhi’s breath was a fast, wet rattle.

Teva could see the bruising line snaking up Alira’s arm from her wrist. A stingburn. A simple stingburn that had turned septic. A week ago, a graft from the blue culture would have flooded the yazhi’s body, burned the infection clean in hours.

Now, nothing. The cultures were too weak. The grafts wouldn't take.

The rattling breath stopped.

The kiva was still.

Elara let out a sound. Not a scream. A low, tearing noise that clawed its way out of her throat. She pulled the blanket tighter around Alira, rocking faster, her body shaking. "No. Alira. No."

Teva watched them all. Rano, his eyes squeezed shut. The paralyzed elders. Her grandmother, fumbling to pick up a blue block from the floor, a look of mild confusion on her face.

Useless.

The sound of Elara's grief echoed off the walls. Teva felt nothing. No tears. No heat.

Just a cold, sharp certainty. A rage that settled deep in her bones, hard and permanent as the limestone.

The adults were broken. They wouldn't act.

She would.
