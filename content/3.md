## 3.1
Keo hung back by the arched entrance to the Council Chamber, in a dim throat that trapped air and the smell of too many bodies. From here, he could see the raised stone shelf that served as a dais and the shadowed mass of nearly two hundred adults packed onto the floor, their forms lit by the bluish glow of the mycelial lattices cultivated in the walls.

The stone under his palm was slick with condensation. The Founders, in their terror of the temporal paradox, had forbidden any markings. The walls were kept bare. No mark, no graffiti, no history. A monument to erasure.

"—is not a theory!" The voice belonged to Marek, Benal’s father. It cracked on the last word, a sound too thin for such a broad, heavy-shouldered man. Keo craned his neck, spotting him near the front. Marek radiated a desperate energy that pushed against the room’s stillness.

"The yazhi in the ground is not a theory," he repeated. "We are failing." Marek pointed not at the Elders, but at a group of figures slumped on a bench near the wall. "The Keepers know it."

Keo’s gaze followed Marek’s finger. Rano sat there, his head in his hands, and the other journeymen beside him were no different, their shoulders bowed, the very image of defeat.

"They have worked for three weeks," Marek pressed, his voice rising. "They are Masters in all but name, and their best effort... their best effort is not enough. The cultures are dimming. The protocol Omya held in her head is gone."

He turned to the three Elders on the natural rise of stone. "The protocols are at Genesis. On metal tablets. In the Archive. It is a locked cache of food, and we are starving because we are afraid to touch the lock!"

"He's right!" a voice shouted from the darkness in the back. Keo couldn't see the speaker. "The Brancher texts are clear! The paradox is a lie! We're on a new branch!"

"Heresy!" The word cut through the rising murmur. It was Elder Sila. She sat at the center of the dais, rigid. Where others looked weary, she looked energized by the crisis. "The Brancher texts are poison. They tell you a comforting lie: that nothing we do matters to the future we left. We are a seed, planted in the past to save the future. Our one, sacred duty is to avoid paradox. One lost lightcell, one metal knife, one footprint where it should not be, and we could erase the entire future we are trying to save."

Elder Hesh, seated to her right, raised a placating hand. He was a gray-haired, patient man, his face laden with responsibility. "Sila is right. The Mission is our law. But even if you would ignore that," he said, his gaze finding Marek, "let us speak of the 'First Walk'."

The chamber stilled. This was their origin story, and their nightmare.

"You speak of Genesis as if it is a supply room," Hesh continued, his voice tapping each word like a chisel. "You forget it took the Founders three years to find this place. Three years of scouting parties that never returned. Three years of fighting for every kilometer of swamp just to find this defensible kiva, this clean water.

"They left Genesis with two hundred colonists," Hesh said, his voice low. "All of them in environmental suits. They had old-tech rifles. They had plasma cutters. They used hard-tech they knew was a paradox risk, because they were desperate. And when they finally established this Enclave... they were ninety-four. We lost over a hundred souls, Marek. Despite all that hard-tech."
Hesh leaned forward. "And you want us to send a team back? Back through that green hell? With what? Croc-spikes and a prayer?"

"And who would we send?" a woman called out from the crowd, her voice rough with practicality. "Our best Explorers? Our Watchers? We strip our own palisade of its defenders for a journey that killed our Founders? It's suicide."

"It is suicide to stay!" Marek shot back. "What future is Sila 'saving' if our yazhi die in their nests! There is no mission if we go extinct first!"

"Better to die with a clean soul," Sila said, "than to live as contaminants."

The chamber erupted. Shouts of "Heresy!" and "Murderer!" clashed, a wave of noise that beat against Keo’s ears. He saw Benal’s mother trying to pull Marek back, to quiet him.

Keo looked away, his chest tightening. His gaze swept the crowd, looking for his parents. He spotted them easily. They stood near the edge, just as he did, defined by their stillness. Explorers. The ones who knew the world outside the palisade. They, of all people, knew the cost Hesh spoke of.

His father’s face hardened. He sat with crossed. His mother watched the Elders, her expression blank. They were silent. They, who had taught Keo to track a razortail and read the sky, were offering nothing. They were as paralyzed as the Elders.

A hand gripped the entrance arch, and Elana, Alira’s mother, pulled herself into the chamber.

The noise stopped. Not all at once, but in a ragged, shamed wave.

She was hollowed out, her eyes sunken holes in a face bleached by grief. She walked, unsteady, into the center of the room. She looked at Sila. She looked at Hesh.

"My... my daughter," she whispered. The chamber’s acoustics, cruel to the arguments, carried her whisper to every corner. "She did not die from a croc. She did not fall from a nest."

Elana looked down at her own hands. "She died... warm. In her own bed. Because the monsters... the monsters in the blood... are back. And we had nothing."

She looked up, her gaze sweeping the crowd, passing over Keo without seeing him.

"Your paradox," she whispered to Sila. "Your First Walk," she said to Hesh. "Your... Mission." Her voice was empty. "They are just words. They are air. My daughter is gone."

She turned and walked out, her bare feet silent on the stone.

The silence she left behind settled, absolute.

Keo watched her go. He thought of her words. The monsters in the blood. He thought of Alira's still form. He thought of his own, useless "everything will be fine" from that morning.

It was a lie. They were all liars.

Marek was speaking again, his voice hoarse. "Do you see? Do you... see? We must..."

Sila was already shaking her head. "The grief is raw. But the protocol..."

Keo couldn't breathe. He couldn't listen to another word. This was not a debate. It was a funeral. They weren't just mourning Alira; they were mourning themselves. They had already given up.

This was the paralysis. It wasn't just shock. It was a choice. They were choosing to be broken.

He looked one last time at his father. His father, his hero, the man who had faced down a saropo herd, met his gaze. And in his father's eyes, Keo saw it. Not anger. Not resolve. Just fear. A deep, paralyzing fear.
His father looked away.

Keo's heart thudded. He pushed off the wall.

He didn't run. He didn't shove. He just turned his back on the Council, on his parents, on the suffocating weight of their failure, and slipped out of the chamber. He walked past the main kiva's dimming central light, ignoring the looks from the door watchers, and headed for the surface.
He needed air.

## 3.2
He shouldered past the ceratops hide that draped the cleft entrance, emerging from the subterranean chill into the hot, wet press of the night. The paralysis of the chamber fell away, replaced by the living wall of insect noise from the jungle beyond the border tangle.

He sucked in a breath of thick air, tasting magnolia and damp earth. It did nothing to slow his hammering heart. He paused, his proximity sense reaching out, and felt a familiar, tightly-coiled mind.

*There*.

Teva stood half-hidden in the spiky shadow of a giant cycad, just beyond the circle of light cast by the kiva's ventilation shaft. Sparks of bioluminescent insects drifted in the air around her. She wasn't looking at the entrance. Her gaze was fixed on the line of the border, her profile a silhouette against the distant, flickering red of the village's cooking fires.

She had been waiting for him.

"It's useless," Keo said. The word was sour on his tongue. "They're just... broken."

"I know." Her voice carried no more echo than a stone dropped in mud.

He walked over, stopping a few feet from her, still resonating with the chamber's toxic energy. "They're going to talk. Hesh and Sila will talk, Marek will yell, and my father... they'll all just talk. Until the last culture dies."

"Let them talk," she said.

He kicked at a root. "Someone has to do something."

"I am."

Keo stopped. The final power of the words cut through his frustration. He studied her. "What?"

Teva turned to face him. Her eyes were shadowed pools, reflecting the drifting insect-light. The numb grief he'd seen after Alira's death was gone, burned away. In its place was a structural certainty, a look he had never seen on her. It was terrifying.

"I'm going," she said.

"Going where? On patrol?" He knew it was a stupid question before he'd even finished.

"Genesis."

The word was a physical blow. Keo’s stomach hollowed. He heard Elder Hesh's voice in his head: A hundred and six souls. With old-tech rifles. With plasma cutters.

"Teva," he whispered. "That's... no. You heard Hesh. It's eighty kilometers. It's a swamp. It's..."

"Suicide," she finished for him. Her voice was laced with a chilling contempt that was aimed not at him, but at the word itself. "Alone, yes. For them, yes. But not for us."

"Us?" The air felt too thin to breathe.

"You and me." She took a step closer. She wasn't asking him; she was telling him. "They're paralyzed by the First Walk. They think it's still a hundred and six dead. But the Founders didn't have us. They didn't have our upgrades."

She ticked the points off, her voice low and precise, like a Keeper reciting a protocol. "We have the baseline immunities. We can eat what we find, drink the water. We have venom resistance. My magnetic sense is perfect—we won't get lost. My balance," she tapped her temple, "my proprioception... I can cross a ravine in the dark. I can heal fast. And you... you can sense a herd from five kilometers. You can feel a razortail pack before it smells you. You can hold Noli's mind. You can feel the world, Keo."

The realization hit him. She hadn't just decided to go. She had strategized. She wasn't talking to Keo, her childhood friend. She was conscripting an asset.

His loyalty, his stupid, hopeful crush, his lifelong habit of being near her—it all twisted into a spike of panic. He couldn't go. He couldn't. He thought of the border tangle, and the real world beyond it. Not the stories, but the things he’d seen on short patrols with his parents. The gore of a T-Rex kill. The ground rattling from a ceratops herd. Murky, flat water broken by hundreds of croc snouts. The calculating chirps of a razortail pack, so much bigger and faster than Noli.

But he also knew, with a sickness in his gut, that she was right. The adults were broken.

"Teva, no," he said, but the word was a puff of air. "We can't. Your grandmother..."

"My grandmother is why I'm going!" she snapped, the first crack in her rigid control. "She's gone, Keo. Rano can't save us. Hesh can't save us. This... this paralysis," she said, spitting the word he'd just thought, "is a luxury. We don't get to be broken. We're the only ones who aren't."

She held his gaze, and her eyes were a challenge. "I am going. With or without you."

She meant it. She would walk out of the border tangle, alone, with nothing but her magnetic sense and that terrifying rage, and the crocs would have her before the first river.

The panic in his chest didn't go away. It just changed. It was no longer the fear of going. It was the terror of letting her go.

He looked at her, at the stony certainty in her face, and his own fear felt thin and useless. His bravado wasn't a mask; it was an impulse, an instinct.

"You're not going alone," he said. His voice was hoarse, but it was steady.

For a second, the iron in her expression flickered. Relief? No. Something else. Just a human easing of the tension in her shoulders.

"Good," she said, turning away to look back at the jungle. "We need Benal."

## 3.3
Teva’s words hung in the air.

Keo stared at her, his mind struggling. Benal? Benal, who spent his days staring at symbols Keo couldn’t understand? Benal, whose father pitied him?

"Teva, what are you talking—"

"You'll have me."

The voice was thin, unsteady. Keo and Teva spun.

Benal unfolded himself from the shadows near the ceratops hide. He was all awkward height and sharp angles, his pale skin looking almost blue in the light of the drifting bioluminescent insects. He was, Keo saw with a jolt, shaking so hard his teeth were chattering.

"Benal?" Keo said, his voice tight with disbelief. "What are you doing here? Go back to your dwelling."

Instead, Benal took a step forward, his hands clenched. "I... I heard you. I was... waiting. To see if..."

He trailed off, swallowing. His eyes darted past Keo's shoulder, toward the border tangle. "Is... is the Watcher... is Liaso on duty tonight?"

"Liaso? Maybe," Keo said, confused. "Why?"

"He's my cousin," Benal whispered. "He told me once... he said the ground outside breathes. He said he saw a T-Rex once. Just... standing. Watching him. For an hour. He said he..." Benal shuddered, a full-body tremor. "I've never been outside. Not once. Just... just standing this close to the edge... my upgrades... I can smell the wet rot out there. I can hear... everything."

A trumpet echoed from the hadrosaur pens, a sound as familiar to Keo as his own heartbeat.

Benal yelped and staggered, slamming into a boulder. His eyes were wide.

Teva didn't move. Keo just watched, a knot of pity and impatience tightening in his chest. This was Benal. This was the boy Teva thought they needed.

"Benal, go home," Keo said. He was trying to be kind, but it came out as a dismissal. "This is real. This is eighty kilometers of mud and crocs and things that will eat you before you can blink. This isn't... it's not math. It's not symbols."

Benal flinched. The panic in his eyes didn't fade, but something angry rose to meet it.

"And Genesis?" Benal's voice was still uneven, but it was sharp. "What will you do when you get there, Keo? Hit it with your spear? Will you, Teva? Will you use your magnetic sense to navigate a command prompt?"

He pushed off the rock, hands balling into fists.

"Genesis is a temporal archive. It's old-tech. It's data. It's symbols. It's the only thing I'm good at. You're... you're the delivery system. I'm the key."

He hitched a breath, and the words, now aimed at Keo, felt like they were meant for his father.

"My work isn't 'dead symbols'," Benal said. "It's temporal anchoring. It's drift mechanics. It's the reason our ancestors couldn't just jump back. It's the reason Sila and Hesh are wrong. They're... they're arguing about a lie. A noble lie, maybe, but... it's still a lie."

He was vibrating, a wire pulled too tight, caught between terror and pride.

"You can get us there," Benal said, his gaze locking with Keo's. "I'm the one who can make it work."

Keo stared.

He saw the terror in Benal's face. He saw the sweat on his forehead, the way he kept swallowing, the tremor that still shook his hands. Benal was, Keo realized, more afraid of the mudwalk than Keo could possibly comprehend. He was terrified of the dark, of the sounds, of the idea of the border tangle. He was probably terrified of them.

And he was here.

He was insisting on coming.

Keo felt a shock of... not pity. It was awe.

He looked from Benal's shuddering resolve to Teva's rage-fueled certainty. His own bravado, his easy "you're not going alone," his morning mantra of "everything will be fine"... it all felt childish. Shallow. He'd agreed to go because he couldn't let Teva go. Teva was going because her grief left her no other path.

Benal was going because his intellect demanded it, even when every fragile part of his body was screaming at him to run.

This was real courage. A courage Keo had never seen.

He gave a sharp nod. The decision, which had been an impulse, a reflex of loyalty, now settled in his gut. It became heavy, final, and real.

"Okay," Keo said. The awe was still in his voice. "Okay, Ben."

He turned to Teva, his mind already shifting. His father's training—the logistical mind of an Explorer—took over.

"But we can't go like this," he said, the words coming fast. "Eighty kilometers. You're right, we have upgrades. But... Teva, you'll overheat in the first savanna." He saw the flash of anger in her eyes but kept going. "And Benal..." He looked at Benal's trembling frame. "You'll be dead in two days. A stingburn, a fall... you're not built for it. Not like this."

Teva looked at him, her eyes questioning, the certainty of her plan hitting its first, practical wall.

"We won't last," Keo said, the idea solidifying, his stomach clenching at the heresy. "Not without old-tech. We need suits."

The word hung in the air, a taboo.

Benal's eyes widened, his intellectual fury vanishing. "Suits? Keo, the... the repository. The inventory. Your parents... they're the custodians. Stealing a suit is..."

"I know," Keo cut him off. The adrenaline was back, but now it was a reckless resolve. He was thinking about locks, about watcher patrols, about the repository's location. "I know whose trust I'm breaking."

He looked at Teva, then at Benal, sealing their pact.

"That's why we go tonight. Right now. Before anyone else decides to 'do something real'."
