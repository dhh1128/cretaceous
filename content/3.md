[ARCHIVAL FRAGMENT: 001-C]

[Declassified Internal Memo: Joint Command] — All conventional research has failed. The Temporal Project is now our only viable path. The Chicxulub Solution is authorized. We go back to find an answer.

Close air, thick with sweat and fear, filled the Council kiva. It was a larger space than the Vitarium, the limestone walls carved with generations of markings, but tonight it felt small. Suffocating.

Keo leaned against the back wall, his arms crossed. The chamber’s acoustics amplified the arguments, turning them into a hollow drone.

"...cannot risk the Archive," Elder Hesh was saying, his voice thin. "The protocols are clear. The paradox..."

"The protocols are failing!" That was Tavan, Benal's father, his voice a low boom of frustration. "Omya can't remember them. Rano's best effort is... not enough. What paradox is worse than this? We are watching our yazhi die."

"We are all grieving Alira," Hesh said, offering a placating gesture. It was useless. "But to panic? To send a team on an eighty-kilometer mudwalk? It's suicide. We would lose more than we gain."

"What about the Brancher texts?" someone else called out. "They say..."

"The Branchers were wrong!"

Frustration tightened Keo's chest. He looked at the elders, at Rano, who sat with his head in his hands. He saw his own parents, standing near the edge, their faces grim masks. He thought of Alira's death. The silence that fell over the village. His own, hollow "everything will be fine" from that morning.

It felt like a lie.

This was the paralysis he'd sensed. It wasn't just shock. It was a choice. They were choosing to be broken.

He couldn't breathe. Keo pushed off the wall and slipped out of the chamber, ignoring the looks from the door watchers. He needed air.

He found Teva by the kiva entrance, half-hidden in the shadow of a broad-leaf palm. The thrum of insects was a relief after the chamber's useless drone.

She wasn't looking at him. Her gaze was fixed on the perimeter logs, her profile a silhouette against the village's cooking fires.

"It's useless," Keo said, the word sour. "They're going to talk until the last culture dies."

"I know." Her voice was flat.

He kicked at a root. "Someone has to do something."

"I am."

Keo stopped. He looked at her. "What?"

Teva turned to face him. Cold certainty had settled on her face. It was a look he'd never seen on her. It terrified him.

"I'm going," she said.

"Going where? The perimeter?"

"The Genesis Site."

The words hung in the hot, wet air. Keo felt a spike of adrenaline, sharp and cold. "Teva, you heard Hesh. It's eighty kilometers of swamp. It's—"

"Suicide," she finished, her voice laced with contempt. "Alone, yes. But not for us."

"Us?"

"You can sense a herd from five kilometers. You can hold a dromaeosaur's mind. I can navigate by the stone. My magnetic sense is perfect. We can get there."

She wasn't asking. She was stating a fact. She had planned this. She'd chosen him. The realization hit him with the force of a physical blow. His loyalty, his stupid, hopeful crush—it all twisted into a knot of sheer panic. He couldn't let her go. He couldn't go with her.

"Teva, no," he said, but his voice was weak.

"I'm going, Keo. With or without you." She held his gaze. "The adults are broken. We're not."

She was right. The word—broken—was the same one he'd just thought. He looked at her, at the absolute, limestone certainty in her eyes, and his own fear felt thin.

"You're not going alone," he said, his voice barely a whisper. "We... we're going."

"You'll need me."

Keo and Teva spun.

Benal unfolded himself from the shadow of the kiva's entrance. He was all awkward height and thin angles, pale in the dusk, and Keo could see his hands were shaking.

"Benal?" Keo said, his voice rough with disbelief. "Go back to your dwelling. This isn't... this is crocs and mud, not... not chalk."

"And the Genesis Site?" Benal's voice was quiet, but it didn't tremble. "What will you do when you get there, Keo? Hit it with your spear? The Archive is old-tech. It's symbols."

He stepped forward, his gaze locking with Keo's. Keo was strong, he knew that. But Benal had never looked small. Now, he looked fragile, breakable. But his eyes were defiant.

"My work isn't 'dead symbols'," Benal said, the words aimed at Keo but meant for his father. "It's the anchor equation. It's temporal mechanics. It's the key. You can get there. I can make it work."

Keo stared. He saw the visible terror in Benal's face. He was terrified of the jungle, of the dark, of them. But he was here. He was insisting.

Keo felt a sudden, shocking wave of awe.

He looked from Benal's terrified resolve to Teva's immovable certainty. His own bravado, his morning mantra, felt childish. This was real.

He gave a short, sharp nod. The decision settled in his gut, heavy and final.

"Okay," Keo said. "But we can't go like this. Eighty kilometers... we won't last two days."

Teva looked at him, her eyes questioning.

"We need old-tech," Keo said, his stomach clenching. "We need suits."

Benal's eyes widened. "The suits are... Keo, your parents..."

"I know," Keo cut him off. He was already thinking, the adrenaline turning to a cold resolve. "That's why we go tonight. Before anyone else decides to 'do something real'."
