[ARCHIVAL FRAGMENT: 001-A]

[Global CDC Alert] — All quarantine protocols have failed. The "Lethe" virus (L-9) is now pandemic in all 12 bio-regions. We have no vaccine. We have no cure. All research efforts have failed.

Mortality rate holding at 99.97%.

The kiva smelled wrong. Not the clean mineral damp of the limestone. Not the faint, yeasty scent of healthy cultures.

Rot.

Stone chilled Teva’s feet as she squinted. Cultures were receding, dying from the edges in. The alcoves that held them were just dim flickers. 

They were supposed to glow.

In the center of the chamber, Rano’s voice was tense. "Omya."

Teva’s grandmother sat at the protocol wall, her hand hovering over the ceramic blocks. Her fingers trembled. She picked up a blue block, then a yellow one. They didn't lock.

"The rust-red," Rano pleaded. "Position one-oh-seven. You know this."

Omya looked up, her eyes wide, lost.

"No." Rano’s voice cracked. He swept the blocks aside. They clattered on the stone.

This was no longer a test, Teva knew. Omya had failed this three times this week. Now it was a hollow avoidance of reality, a wishful enactment by the elders who huddled in the shadows.

Teva looked away from her grandmother’s shame.

A frantic mother crouched near the kiva's entrance, rocking a bundle of limbs and cloth that breathed in a fast, wet rattle.

The woman had interrupted their test with a burst, begging an upgrade for her child. She'd shown them the bruising line snaking up the yazhi's arm, said it started with a simple stingburn. Then she'd taken in Omya's puzzled stare, and the hesitation of the elders, and she'd trailed off...

Teva’s jaw ached. She'd seen this before, two years ago. Same infection as her own mother. Same paralysis.

The rattling breath stopped.

The kiva was still.

A groan tore from the mother's throat. "No. Alira. No."

Teva watched them all. Rano, his eyes squeezed shut. The paralyzed elders. Her grandmother, fumbling to pick up a blue block from the floor, a look of mild confusion on her face.

Sounds of grief echoed, but Teva's jaw unclenched. She felt no tears, no heat -- just a cold, sharp certainty. A rage settled deep in her bones, hard and permanent as the limestone.

The adults were broken. They wouldn't act.

She would.
