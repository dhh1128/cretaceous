[ARCHIVAL FRAGMENT: 001-A]

[Global CDC Alert] — All quarantine protocols have failed. The "Lethe" virus (L-9) is now pandemic in all 12 bio-regions. We have no vaccine. We have no cure.

Mortality rate holding at 99.97%.

The Vitarium smelled wrong.

Teva had registered it before her eyes adjusted to the dimness. It wasn't the clean, mineral damp of the limestone kiva, a scent that had meant safety all her life. It wasn't the faint, yeasty perfume of healthy cultures.

This was rot. A sweet, denatured-protein decay that clung to the back of her throat and spoke of failure.

Limestone sapped warmth from her bare feet. She stood in the opening of the recessed chamber—a natural cleft in the larger kiva—fists clenched at her sides.

Inside, the light was dying.

The Vitarium was a living constellation. Clefts in the rock held dozens of lopsided clay vessels. Each mimicked a random clump of clay to hide its workmanship -- a precaution against paradoxes. And each should have held a living light. Bioluminescent mycelial lattices, calibrated to specific wavelengths, lit the cultures and served as a diagnostic.

Now, they were just sickly flickers receding from the edges. A guttering yellow. A murky, apoptotic blue.

Another sound cut the air. A wet rattle.

It came from the main kiva, just behind her. A counter-rhythm to the other sound in the chamber: the pleading voice of Rano, one of the Journeyman Keepers.

"Omya. Please. Focus."

In the center of the chamber, Teva’s grandmother sat at the protocol station. Her silver hair was plaited in the intricate loops of a Master Keeper, but the hands that hovered over the sequencing tray were not a Master's. They trembled.

Omya was the last Master Keeper. The other two had been lost to the floods last season. Now, there was only Omya. And Omya was... disappearing.

"The rust-red," Rano pleaded. His voice was raw. He was kind, Teva knew, but that kindness was worn thin, sanded away by weeks of this. "Position one-oh-seven. The final fold protocol. You know this."

Teva's jaw locked. Omya did know this. Teva had watched her do it a hundred times. Her grandmother’s mind had been a fortress, a living archive of the complex synthesis that kept them all alive. It was Omya who had taught Teva to identify the amino acid sequences by their scent markers on the breeze, who had drilled her on the protein folds until Teva could see them in her sleep.

“Precision, Teva,” she used to say, her voice as crisp as an old leaf. “We are scientists, not shamans. This work is not magic. It is knowledge. And knowledge must be perfect.”

Now, that precise mind was fumbling.

The sequencing tray held dozens of protein-gel keys, each a different color. They were designed to dissolve into dust if they ever left the Vitarium's humidity.

Omya picked up a blue key. She squinted at it, head tilted, as if examining a strange pebble. She picked up a yellow one. She tried to fit them into the sequence. They wouldn't lock. The tray remained dark.

"No," Rano’s voice cracked. He was a man who knew eighty percent of the synthesis process, which was one hundred percent useless. "The vector, Omya. We need the T-Cell Activation vector. The rust-red."

Teva knew what he was asking for. The T-Cell vector was the baseline of their immunity, the first line of defense against the plagues of this world. Without it, a simple stingburn could kill.

Omya looked up. Her eyes were wide, lost. They scanned past Rano, past the dying lights, and settled on Teva. For a heartbeat, recognition flickered. A flash of the woman who had taught her to read the stars.

Then it was gone. Omya turned back to the tray and offered Rano the blue key.

"For the *pan*...?" she whispered in a dry rustle.

Teva went rigid. *Pan*. The cycad bread. Omya was lost in the Lysine/Digestive protocols, a simple nutritional synthesis. She was confusing a life-saving medicine with food.

Rano made a fist. With a strangled cry, he swept the gels from the sequencing tray. They hit the stone floor with a wet slap, already losing their shape.

This was cowardice. A hollow ritual performed by the elders lurking in the shadows of the main kiva, pretending not to watch. Their fear was a smell as potent as the rot; a paralysis gripped the Enclave.

Teva looked away from her grandmother’s shame. She couldn't bear it.

Her gaze fell on the kiva's entrance, to the source of the wet rattle. Elana crouched there, rocking a bundle of limbs and cloth.

Elana had burst in an hour ago. Voice frantic, she interrupted the "test." She had begged for an upgrade for her child, Alira. She'd held the yazhi's arm out for them to see. A bruised line snaked up from a stingburn on the wrist.

"It's the same," Elana had wept. "It's the same as the others."

Then she'd taken in Omya's puzzled stare, Rano's despair, and the unmoving elders. And she had trailed off. Her pleas dried up into the rattling sobs that now echoed the breath of her dying child.

Alira. She was two and a half. No longer just a yazhi, but a named person.

Teva’s jaw tightened until her teeth ached. She'd seen this before. Two years ago.

The same infection. The same paralysis.

Her mother, who had carried the gene for enhanced magnetic sense, who could navigate a white-out fog by the pull in her bones, had been laid low by a bite. The Keepers then had been healthy. The protocols had worked. They had synthesized the vector, administered the Seeding.

And it had failed. The upgrade didn't take.

Teva remembered the sound of her mother's breathing. That same wet rattle. She remembered the smell of the rot.

Now, Alira wouldn't even get the chance.

The wet rattle hitched.

Subsided.

Stopped.

Silence crushed the chamber. It was a weight, pressing the air from the kiva.

A groan tore from Elana's throat—a sound stripped of everything human, the noise of a trapped animal. "No. Alira. No. No..."

Teva watched them all. Rano stood with face pale and eyes squeezed shut. The paralyzed elders lurked in the shadows. Their heads bowed as if in prayer to gods they didn't believe in.

And her grandmother.

Omya bent down. Her joints popped in the quiet. She picked up the blue gel from the floor. It was already starting to deform in her palm. A look of confusion crossed her face, as if seeing it for the first time.

The sounds of Elana's grief echoed from the limestone walls, but Teva's jaw unclenched. She felt no tears, no heat. Just a rage as hard as the kiva floor.

The adults were broken. They were fumbling with the past, lost in protocols they no longer understood, praying for a miracle while the future died in their arms.

They wouldn't act.

She would.
