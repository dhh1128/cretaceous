Keo’s world had shrunk to the rasp of his father’s breathing.

He lay on his own fern-fiber mat, motionless, listening. The village was silent, wrapped in the humid dark. 2100, the time of the deepest sleep, had passed. 0100 was still an hour away. This was the window.

From the other side of the fern-screen divider, Joram’s breath came, a deep saw-stroke. Riel’s was a softer puff, almost inaudible. But Keo could hear it. His upgrades left him no peace, cataloging every sound: the skitter of a crawler on the thatch roof; the distant grind of a hadrosaur shifting its weight in the labor pen; the drip of condensation from a leaf onto their woven vine wall.

And the breathing. Steady. Asleep.

Now.

He slid from his mat. No sound. His bare feet touched the floor for only a moment before he reached his gear pile.

Working in silence, he pulled on a close-fitting tunic and leggings made of tough-woven fiber, designed to shed water and resist the worst stingburns. Over them, he laced his boots. They were not old-tech, but hardened hadrosaur hide, with soles of pressed bark that gave purchase on rock and mud. He stood, testing his weight.

He paused, letting his proximity sense spread. It was a tingling pressure, his mind’s hand feeling the shape of the room. He felt the two sleeping minds nearby—warm, banked coals of consciousness. He felt the small, cold mind of a grounder burrowing in the earth 30 meters below. And further, at the edge of his perception, the anxious spark of Noli, waiting.

Good.

His fieldpack lay by the dwelling’s entrance, mostly packed. The coiled fiber-cord. The spare water skin. The chert-knife, its knapped edge sharp enough to shave hair, tucked into its leather sheath.

All he needed was food.

He padded to the larder. A woven basket held a half-dozen strips of "journey-pan," the dense, dark-crust flatbread that could keep a person moving for a day. He took three. His fingers brushed a greasy pouch. Dried crawlers, roasted and salted. High protein. He took two handfuls.

It was *their* food. Theirs. Joram and Riel’s. The food they had earned on their last expedition, the food they were rationing.

Guilt pressed, a physical weight in his chest, heavier than any fieldpack. This was the real fear. Not the jungle. Not the crocs. The shame.

He was stealing from them. He wasn't just taking food; he was about to steal the suits. Their job. Their status as custodians was built on trust. By morning, that trust would be gone. He was destroying their lives.

He froze.

From the other side of the divider, the breathing pattern changed. Joram’s slow rasp hitched, then resumed. But Riel’s... Riel’s had stopped.

Keo’s heart hammered a single, painful beat. He didn't move. He didn't breathe. He focused his proximity sense, pushing it like a needle.

Her mind was stirring. Rising from the deep waves of sleep into a restless state.

He could smell her. Beyond the scent of sleep and sweat, he caught the faint, chemical tang that always clung to his parents. The Barrier. That complex, amber-colored synthesis of T. rex musk and necrotic tissue that signaled danger to every predator in the jungle. It was the scent of survival. The scent of Explorers.

He was stealing from them.

"Keo?"

His mother’s voice was a slurred whisper, thick with sleep.

Cold spiked in Keo’s stomach. He squeezed his eyes shut. Don't answer. Don't move. Be a dream. Be a shadow.

"Joram...?" Riel murmured. "Did you... hear..."

"S'nothing," his father grunted, his voice a rumble, never fully waking. "G'back to sleep, Ri."

Keo heard the rustle of their mat. He felt her mind hover, confused, a spark of anxiety. He's not in his bed. He knew the thought was about to form.

No.

He thought of the Vitarium. The dimming, sick-yellow light. He thought of Teva’s face, cold and brittle with rage. He thought of the yazhi, Alira, her frail chest still. The "monsters in the blood."

This isn't a betrayal, he told himself, the lie sticking in his throat. It's a rescue.

He waited. One breath. Ten. A hundred.

He felt her mind loosen its grip, the anxiety fading. She sighed, a puff of warm air, and her breathing deepened, falling back in rhythm with Joram’s.

She was asleep.

Keo let out a shaking breath. His tunic was plastered to his back. He finished packing the food, his hands clumsy, the guilt now mixed with a sour, adrenaline-laced relief.

He slung the fieldpack over one shoulder. It was heavier than it should be.

He moved to the entrance of the nest, a round opening in the floor. The ladder, a thick rope with notched hardwood rungs, dropped 30 meters into the darkness.

He glanced back one last time. The fern divider hid them, but he could feel them. His parents. The two people he trusted most. The two he had just betrayed.

I'm sorry. The thought was a useless, childish pang.

He slipped onto the rungs and descended, hand over hand.

Halfway down, a shadow detached itself from the base of the nearest tree.

Noli.

She was a patch of feathered night, her yazhi-sized body tense, her head cocked.

Quiet.

Keo didn't just think it; he drove the intent, a cold spike of command.

Noli instantly flattened her ears, sinking into a crouch. Her anxiety was still there, but it was caged. He felt the familiar, dull ache of strain begin behind his eyes, but he held the push.

His boots touched the mulchy ground.

He stood for a moment, the wall of jungle sound washing over him—a million insect-thrums, the groans of trees, the distant hoot of a night bird. The Enclave perimeter was 500 meters away. Beyond it, the world that had killed his sister. The world he was now walking into, willingly.

He looked up. The nest was a woven mass against the stars, impossibly high. He had done it. He was out. The guilt was still there, a cold knot in his stomach, but now something else was layered on top of it: an irreversible resolve.

He gave Noli a silent hand signal, a brush of his fingers against his thigh. Heel.

The dromaeosaur rose, a silent hunter, and fell in at his side.

Keo turned his back on his home and moved through the slumbering village, a ghost heading for the suit repository.

---

Suits were kept in a low, reinforced chamber built of stone and thick logs, set near the Council kiva. It was secure. It was dark.

Noli stayed at the entrance, her head low, a perfect sentinel. Keo approached the door. A heavy stone, suspended on a fiber-rope pulley, held the locking bar in place. He knew this mechanism. He'd watched his parents operate it.

His hands, slick with sweat, fumbled with the release pin. He eased it free. The rope pulley groaned.

Keo froze.

The sound was swallowed by the jungle's night-song, but his heart hammered his ribs. He listened, his hearing stretching, tasting the night air. A cough, far off. The click of a crawler on stone. No alarm.

He let his breath out. He lifted the bar and slipped inside.

The air hit him first. Cool, dry, and sharp with the scent of old-tech—a sterile tang of polymer and dormant circuits. Dim light from the ventilation slits showed him the rack.

Twelve suits. Only twelve left from the original two hundred.

They hung like shed skins, their chromatophore surfaces shifting in the faint light, patterns of leaf and shadow moving over them. They looked alive.

He grabbed the first suit. It was light, barely 3 kilograms. He pulled a second.

One for Teva. For her poor thermal regulation. One for Benal. For his fragile frame.

He looked at the third suit on the rack. His size. He just had to reach out and take it.

No. The thought was sharp, born of pride. He was strong. He was fast. He had his senses. He didn't need a crutch. He would prove he was better than the old-tech.

He left the third suit on the rack.

A scrape of stone on stone. Outside.

Keo’s heart hammered. He pressed himself against the wall, Noli’s warning a silent pressure in his mind.

A silhouette passed the ventilation slit. A watcher, spear held low, making his rounds. Keo held his breath, counting. One. Two. Three.

The footsteps faded.

He jammed the two suits into his empty fieldpack, reset the locking bar, and slipped back into the night.

---

He found them in the palm grove near the northern palisade, just where they'd agreed. Teva stood like a statue, her spear in hand. Benal was a knot of shadows, vibrating with tension.

Keo emerged from the darkness. He dropped the fieldpack. "Here."

Teva opened the pack. She pulled one suit free, her face a grim mask in the gloom. Benal reached for the other. A tremor ran through his arm as he took it, his knuckles white on the alien fabric.

"Now," Keo whispered.

He led them to the perimeter, Noli moving at his heel like a ghost. The log palisade was a dark wall between the village and the jungle. A watcher stood on a platform twenty meters to their left, his shape a dark cutout against the stars.

Keo watched him. The man stamped his feet, shifted his spear, and stared out into the black.

Keo pointed to a low spot, where a rotted log had created a gap, partially obscured by ferns. He waited. The watcher turned, his patrol taking him to the far end of his platform.

"Go," Keo breathed.

Teva went first, sliding through the gap like a snake. Benal followed, clumsy, catching his pack on a splinter. He stifled a gasp.

Keo grabbed his arm, steadied him, and shoved him through.

He looked back one last time at the sleeping tree houses. The guilt was a cold knot in his stomach.

I’m sorry.

He pushed the command to Noli, and together they slipped through the gap. The thick, wet air of the jungle enveloped them. The wall of noise Keo had tuned out that morning slammed into him.

The 80-kilometer mudwalk had begun.
