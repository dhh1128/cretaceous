The village slept, wrapped in the hot, insect-chirring dark. Keo moved soundlessly down the ladder from his family's dwelling, his bare feet finding familiar holds.

He paused on the ground, letting his senses adjust. Above, in the tree house, his parents were asleep. Custodians. Explorers. The two people he trusted most. The two he was about to betray.

Guilt pressed, a physical weight in his chest, heavier than any fieldpack. This was the real fear. Not the jungle. Not the crocs. The shame. He was stealing from them. He was breaking their trust.

He glanced back. His mother shifted. Keo flinched, his hand tightening on the haft of his spear.

Noli, who had been waiting by the ladder's base, let out a low, questioning whuff.

Quiet, Keo pushed. He didn't just think it; he drove the intent, a sharp, cold spike. Noli flattened her ears and sank into a shadow, a feathered patch of night.

Keo slung his fieldpack over one shoulder. It held a water skin, a length of cord, and a hard strip of dried carne. It wasn't enough.

He turned his back on his home and moved toward the suit repository.

Suits were kept in a low, reinforced chamber built of stone and thick logs, set near the Council kiva. It was secure. It was dark.

Noli stayed at the entrance, her head low, a perfect sentinel. Keo approached the door. A heavy stone, suspended on a fiber-rope pulley, held the locking bar in place. He knew this mechanism. He'd watched his parents operate it.

His hands, slick with sweat, fumbled with the release pin. He eased it free. The rope pulley groaned.

Keo froze.

The sound was swallowed by the jungle's night-song, but his heart hammered his ribs. He listened, his hearing stretching, tasting the night air. A cough, far off. The click of a crawler on stone. No alarm.

He let his breath out. He lifted the bar and slipped inside.

The air hit him first. Cool, dry, and sharp with the scent of old-tech—a sterile tang of polymer and dormant circuits. Dim light from the ventilation slits showed him the rack.

Twelve suits. Only twelve left from the original two hundred.

They hung like shed skins, their chromatophore surfaces shifting in the faint light, patterns of leaf and shadow moving over them. They looked alive.

He grabbed the first suit. It was light, barely 3 kilograms. He pulled a second.

One for Teva. For her poor thermal regulation. One for Benal. For his fragile frame.

He looked at the third suit on the rack. His size. He just had to reach out and take it.

No. The thought was sharp, born of pride. He was strong. He was fast. He had his senses. He didn't need a crutch. He would prove he was better than the old-tech.

He left the third suit on the rack.

A scrape of stone on stone. Outside.

Keo’s heart hammered. He pressed himself against the wall, Noli’s warning a silent pressure in his mind.

A silhouette passed the ventilation slit. A watcher, spear held low, making his rounds. Keo held his breath, counting. One. Two. Three.

The footsteps faded.

He jammed the two suits into his empty fieldpack, reset the locking bar, and slipped back into the night.

He found them in the palm grove near the northern palisade, just where they'd agreed. Teva stood like a statue, her spear in hand. Benal was a knot of shadows, vibrating with tension.

Keo emerged from the darkness. He dropped the fieldpack. "Here."

Teva opened the pack. She pulled one suit free, her face a grim mask in the gloom. Benal reached for the other. A tremor ran through his arm as he took it, his knuckles white on the alien fabric.

"Now," Keo whispered.

He led them to the perimeter, Noli moving at his heel like a ghost. The log palisade was a dark wall between the village and the jungle. A watcher stood on a platform twenty meters to their left, his shape a dark cutout against the stars.

Keo watched him. The man stamped his feet, shifted his spear, and stared out into the black.

Keo pointed to a low spot, where a rotted log had created a gap, partially obscured by ferns. He waited. The watcher turned, his patrol taking him to the far end of his platform.

"Go," Keo breathed.

Teva went first, sliding through the gap like a snake. Benal followed, clumsy, catching his pack on a splinter. He stifled a gasp.

Keo grabbed his arm, steadied him, and shoved him through.

He looked back one last time at the sleeping tree houses. The guilt was a cold knot in his stomach.

I’m sorry.

He pushed the command to Noli, and together they slipped through the gap. The thick, wet air of the jungle enveloped them. The wall of noise Keo had tuned out that morning slammed into him.

The 80-kilometer mudwalk had begun.
