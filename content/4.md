## 4.1

Keo’s world had shrunk to the rasp of his father’s breathing.

He lay on his own fern-fiber mat, motionless, listening. The village lay silent in the humid dark. 2100, the time of the deepest sleep, had passed. 0100 was still an hour away. This was the window.

From the other side of the fern-screen divider, Joram’s breath sawed—deep and rhythmic. Riel’s was a softer puff. But Keo could hear it. His upgrades left him no peace, cataloging every sound: the skitter of a crawler on the thatch roof; the distant grind of a hadrosaur shifting its weight in the labor pen; the drip of condensation from a leaf onto their woven vine wall.

And the breathing. Steady. Asleep.

Now.

He slid from his mat. No sound. His bare feet touched the floor for only a moment before he reached his gear pile.

Working in silence, he pulled on a close-fitting tunic and leggings made of tough-woven fiber, designed to shed water and resist the worst stingburns. Over them, he laced his boots. They were not old-tech, but hardened hadrosaur hide, with soles of pressed bark that gave purchase on rock and mud. He stood and tested his weight.

He paused to let his proximity sense spread. A tingling pressure filled the room—his mind’s hand tracing the shape of the space. He felt the two sleeping minds nearby—warm, banked coals of consciousness. He felt a grounder’s cold mind burrowing 30 meters below. And further, at the edge of his perception, the anxious spark of Noli, waiting.

Good.

His fieldpack waited by the dwelling’s entrance. The coiled fiber-cord. The spare water skin. The chert-knife, sharp enough to shave hair, rested in its leather sheath.

All he needed was food.

He padded to the larder. A woven basket held a half-dozen strips of "journey-pan," the dense, dark-crust flatbread that could keep a person moving for a day. He took three. His fingers brushed a greasy pouch. Dried crawlers, roasted and salted. High protein. He took two handfuls.

It was *their* food. Theirs. Joram and Riel’s. The food they had earned on their last expedition, the food they were rationing.

Guilt pressed on his chest, heavier than any fieldpack. This was the real fear. Not the jungle. Not the crocs. The shame.

He was stealing from them. He wasn't just taking food; he was about to steal the suits. Their job. Their status as custodians was built on trust. By morning, that trust would be gone. He was destroying their lives.

He froze.

Beyond the divider, the rhythm broke. Joram’s rasp hitched, then resumed. But Riel’s... Riel’s had stopped.

Keo’s heart hammered a painful beat. He didn't move. He didn't breathe. He focused his proximity sense, driving it like a needle.

Her mind stirred, rising from deep waves into restlessness.

He could smell her. Beyond the musk of sleep and sweat, he caught the faint, chemical tang that always clung to his parents. The Barrier. That complex synthesis of T. rex musk and necrotic tissue that signaled danger to every predator in the jungle. It was the scent of survival. The scent of Explorers.

He was stealing from them.

"Keo?"

His mother’s voice was a slurred whisper.

Ice spiked in Keo’s stomach. He squeezed his eyes shut. Don't answer. Don't move. Be a dream. Be a shadow.

"Joram...?" Riel murmured. "Did you... hear..."

"S'nothing," his father grunted, his voice a rumble, never fully waking. "G'back to sleep, Ri."

Keo heard the rustle of their mat. He felt her mind hover in confused anxiety. He's not in his bed. He knew the thought was about to form.

No.

He thought of the Vitarium. The sick-yellow light. He thought of Teva’s cold, brittle face. He thought of the yazhi, Alira, her frail chest still. The "monsters in the blood."

This isn't a betrayal, he told himself. The lie stuck in his throat. It's a rescue.

He waited. One breath. Ten. A hundred.

He felt her mind loosen its grip, the anxiety fading. She sighed out warm air. Her breathing deepened, falling back in rhythm with Joram’s.

She was asleep.

Keo let out a shaking breath. His tunic was plastered to his back. He finished packing with clumsy hands. Guilt mixed with sour, adrenaline-laced relief.

He slung the fieldpack over one shoulder. It was heavier than it should be.

He moved to the entrance of the nest, a round opening in the floor. The notched rope ladder dropped 30 meters into the dark.

He glanced back one last time. The fern divider hid them, but he could feel them. His parents. The two people he trusted most. The two he had just betrayed.

I'm sorry. The thought was a useless, childish pang.

He slipped onto the rungs and descended.

Halfway down, a shadow detached itself from the base of the nearest tree.

Noli.

She was a patch of feathered night—head cocked, body tense.

Quiet.

Keo didn't just think it; he drove the intent, a cold spike of command.

Noli instantly flattened her ears, sinking into a crouch. Her anxiety was still there, but it was caged. He felt the familiar, dull ache of strain begin behind his eyes, but he held the push.

His boots touched the mulchy ground.

He stood for a moment as the wall of jungle sound washed over him—a million insect-thrums, the groans of trees, the distant hoot of a night bird. The Enclave perimeter was 500 meters away. Beyond it, the world that had killed his sister. The world he was now walking into, willingly.

He looked up. The nest was a woven mass against the stars, impossibly high. He had done it. He was out. Guilt still sat like a cold knot in his stomach, but an irreversible resolve now layered over it.

He signaled Noli—a brush of fingers against his thigh. Heel.

The dromaeosaur rose and came to his side.

Keo turned his back on his home. He passed through the sleeping village, heading for the suit repository.

## 4.2

Keo moved fast, Noli silent at his side. The Enclave’s central structures lay behind them, lost in the forming ground-mist. Noli vibrated with a low whine.

“Watch,” Keo projected. She sank into the ferns and vanished.

He faced the Repository. Less a building than a bunker, it was a reinforced chamber dug into the earth and wedged between the massive, buttressed roots of an ancient coniferale and a cluster of limestone boulders. It was his parents’ charge, and he was there as a thief.

There was no old-tech lock. A massive, unworked limestone slab secured the entrance, balanced by a hidden counterweight system of woven-vine rope and sandbags. Keo placed his hands on the stone. He didn't push; he eased his weight against it while his other hand found the hidden release-grip. He felt the tension shift as the counterweights took the load. The stone didn’t scrape; it floated back on a bed of pressurized air from a simple bladder, a whisper of escaping pressure.

He froze. Listened to the jungle’s night-song. No alarm. He slipped inside. The stone hissed shut behind him.

He stood in a vast hollow, dim but not dark. Yellow-green bioluminescence pulsed from cultivated lightmold across the ceiling.

The air was still. Limestone-damp and heavy with the sterile, electric tang of old-tech—ozone, polymer, and dormant circuits.

The place felt like a graveyard. Skeletal racks of lashed tree branches filled the chamber. Most were empty. This was where nearly two hundred suits had once hung. The emptiness pressed down with crushing weight—the 180 stories of failure, of crocs and rockfalls and failing tech.

At the very back, on a single horizontal pole, hung 12 survivors.

Right away, he spotted the pair his parents used. Their chromatophore surfaces rippled slowly in a dormant camouflage pattern. He knew every patched sensor on his mother's, the new-grown biofilm on his father's. Hot, acidic shame flooded his throat. He was betraying the custodians. He was in their most hallowed space, a place he only knew because of their trust.

Those two, he would not touch.

He turned to the stash of bio-safe weapons. He needed to ground himself with the replaceable. He selected a 2.5-meter croc-spike tipped with a massive Deinosuchus tooth. Then a razor-club, the heavy head slotted with the slicing teeth of a razortail pack. Last, a knapped chert-knife for his belt.

Then his gaze lifted to the limestone shelf behind. The taboo items, each carefully wrapped. Metal-tipped spears. Three dead shock-prods. And the machete. The steel blade gleamed, oiled and pristine. Keo knew the story. A first-generation Explorer had lost it in a river. They’d lost two men, both suited, to a Deinosuchus pack just trying to retrieve it from the mud. The blade was a relic, bought with blood, and a paradox they could not afford to lose again.

The taboo items exuded a faint scent of soured figs. This, he knew, was the containment protocol, the final paradox failsafe. Like gels in the suits, the wrappings around each old-tech item were impregnated with dormant, engineered archaea. If the custodians failed to apply the nutrient-balm in their weekly ritual, or if the chamber was breached by flood or rockfall, the archaea would wake. They were designed to activate, consume, and neutralize every trace of old-tech, dissolving metal to powdery rust and polymers to a sterile, organic sludge within hours.

This was the last promise: their mistakes would die with them.

He turned again to the ten remaining suits. His real task. He had to choose. He ran his hand over one. The biofilm was scarred and patchy; its camouflage would be unreliable. Another had dead chemical capsules at the wrist, indicators dark. This was the reality of their decaying inheritance.

He found a good one. Teva’s size. He checked the wrist panel: thermal system green. He felt the sensor nodes around the collar, the full chemical deterrent capsules. He pulled it from its hanger.

It was impossibly light.

The old-tech magic never failed to amaze him. It looked like it should weigh twenty kilograms. It was barely three. He folded it; the living material resisted, then relaxed. He laid it on the floor.

He scanned the rack for the largest suit, the one for Benal. He found it. It wasn't perfect. One shoulder capacitor red-lined on the diagnostic panel; the shock grid was compromised. But its physical integrity was sound, the aerogel layer intact, the venom-protection viable. It would have to do. He pulled it down. It was just as light.

The third suit on the rack was his. His size. His configuration. It hung there shimmering—a perfect defense.

He just had to reach out.

No.

The thought was stark, born of pride that felt like a vital organ. He was strong. He had his senses, his healing, his projection. He was Joram and Riel’s son. He didn't need a crutch. He would prove he was better than the old-tech.

He left the third suit on the rack.

A scrape. Stone on stone. Outside.

Keo’s heart seized.

Noli’s warning slammed into his mind—*DangerClose*.

He doused his thoughts and pressed himself into the shadows between the empty poles. He was trapped. A thief.

A muffled cough drifted down the ventilation shaft.

Then he smelled it—an unmistakable scent wafting from the vent. The musky, septic tang of a pheromone barrier, sharp with sweat.

Benal's cousin.

*Move. Just move on, Liaso.*

Keo’s lungs burned. His heart hammered. The stone slab was sealed. Liaso had upgraded senses, too. If he was suspicious, if he heard Keo’s heart, if he called an alarm...

The footsteps faded.

Keo sagged against a rack, pressing his forehead to the bark. He shook so hard his teeth clicked.

He forced the panic down. Work. Move.

He unslung his fieldpack and slung the suits through the straps, then pushed his arms through again and tested the weight with a shrug. Awkward, but he only had to carry the suits for a few minutes. He shouldered the croc-spike and razor-club and moved to the door.

His hands were slick, but they knew the mechanism. He balanced the weight, eased the stone back, and slipped out into the fog. The stone hissed shut. He barely heard the click of the counterweights.

Noli materialized from the mist.

*We go*, he projected. *Now*.

## 4.3

Keo found them in the palm grove near the northern border-tangle, just where they'd agreed. Thicker here, the fog rolled in a tide that shredded on the serrated edges of the palm fronds.

Teva stood rigid with her back to him. She held a croc-spike, and was so still she could have been mistaken for a shadow carved from the gloom. Benal huddled at the base of a tree, a knot of misery with knees drawn to his chest. He trembled.

Noli, sensing their tension, whined deep in her chest.

Quiet, Keo projected, sharpening the command. The dromaeosaur flinched and sank to her belly, her purple-black feathers melting into the mud.

As Keo emerged from the fog, his proximity sense brushed theirs. Benal sprang to his feet with a choke. Teva was already turning; her own muted sense had felt his approach. Her spike was half-raised, not in surprise, but in challenge.

"You have them." It wasn't a question. Her voice was flat, impatient.

"Here." Keo let the heavy fieldpack slide from his shoulder. It landed with the weapons—the croc-spike and the razor-club—on the mulchy ground. The pack landed with a thunderous thud.

Teva was on the pack in a second, tearing at the straps. She pulled the first suit free. It slithered out, the living fabric shimmering with dormant chromatophores.

Benal just stared, arms pinned to his sides. He shook his head in a violent tic.

"I... can't." Benal’s voice was a croak. His upgraded hearing was a curse. In the silence of the village, he was jumpy; out here, the wall of jungle sound—a million insects, the groans of distant saropos, the drip of water—was a physical assault. "It's too... it's too much. I can't..."

"Drink," Keo ordered, ignoring him for a second. He unhooked his own water skin. "Both of you. And empty. Now. Before the suits."

He pointed to the base of the palms. The command was so practical, so mundane, it broke Benal’s paralysis. Teva disappeared into the ferns without a word. Stiff with shame, Benal followed.

When they returned, Keo tossed the larger suit at Benal's feet. "Get it on. Teva."

"I... I don't know..." she started, her flat tone breaking for a moment.

"Just step into it. It seals itself."

Teva fumbled for a moment, then stepped into the suit, one leg at a time. She pulled it up, her movements hesitant, then decisive as she drew the old-tech sealant tab. It hissed shut. The effect was immediate.

The chromatophores woke.

The living skin of the suit tasted the light and shadow around her. It flowed in a ripple of charcoal, lichen, and fog-white. In a second, Teva was gone. She was no longer a person. She was a wisp of night and mist, a void in the shape of a girl. Keo felt a jolt of reassurance; the old-tech was real. It worked.

He turned to Benal. "Benal."

Benal fumbled with his suit. His trembling hands couldn't find the opening. A spasm seized his stomach. He stumbled and clamped a hand over his mouth, and retched into the ferns. Nothing came up but bile. He wiped his mouth, his whole body shaking with fresh shame.

Keo’s impatience evaporated. He saw the "insane courage" he'd glimpsed at the kiva—the courage of the petrified who moves forward anyway.

"It's all right," Keo said, his voice quiet. "I've got you." He helped Benal find the footholds, guiding his trembling legs in. "That's it. Pull."

Benal, with a choked sob, obeyed. He zipped the suit. The chromatophores rippled over his lanky frame, turning him into a wavering pillar of shadow.

Benal let out a shuddering breath and cocked his head. "The... the thrum."

"What?"

"The insect-wall. It’s... gone." He looked at Keo, his eyes wide with dizzying relief. "The suit. It... it filtered the background. I can... I can think."

"Good." A flush of foolish pride hit Keo. He was the only one unarmored. The only one exposed. "Weapons and food. Quick."

Keo shouldered his fieldpack and took the 2.5-meter croc-spike he had stolen. "Spike. Knife. Journey-pan and crawlers."

Teva hefted her own spike with a sure grip. "Spike. Knife. Same food."

Benal, his hands still shaking, picked up the razor-club. It looked absurdly heavy in his slender grip. "This. And a sling." He fumbled in his own pack. "And I... I brought salves. For stingburn. And... wounds. And two chemical-pods."

Keo nodded, impressed. "Good. Food?"

"Journey-pan," Benal whispered. "I... I forgot the protein."

"We'll manage." Keo clapped him on the shoulder, the suited-fabric cool and alien. "Now," he said, his voice tight. "The Barrier."

He led them to the border-tangle itself, a 15-meter-high wall of woven vines, felled logs, and living trees. Noli began to whine, her body going rigid. The T-rex musk was thick here.

Stay, Keo projected—a psychic bruise.

He ran his hand along the tangle, his nose guiding him. "Here." He stopped at a ceramic nodule, weeping a viscous amber synthesis. "On your suits. Exposed skin. Hands, neck, face. Don't miss a spot."

They smeared the septic gel over themselves. It smelled of a wounded alpha and carrion. It was the scent of Flee or die.

The reek hit Noli.

It wasn't a whine this time. It was a psychic shriek in Keo’s head. Noli thrashed, her claws digging dirt, trying to bolt.

No.

Keo grabbed her, fisting his hand in her feathers. He drove his intent—a lance of command: Safe. With me. Trust. He felt the pressure build behind his eyes. Noli’s panic was a wild, thrashing thing. He couldn't crush it; he could only contain it. He held the projection, a leaden weight in his skull, and forced his own calm into her. Her trembling eased, but only because he was mentally pinning her in place.

"The... the watcher," he grunted, the strain making his voice tight.

Twenty meters to their left, high on a platform, a dark cutout stood against the stars. The man stamped his feet, shifted his spike, and stared out into the black.

"He'll turn," Keo whispered. "The gap is here." He pointed to a low spot, where a rotted log had created an opening, partially obscured by ferns. "Teva, then Benal, then me. Move on my signal."

They waited. The watcher stamped his feet again, then turned to patrol the far end of his platform, his back to them.

"Now," Keo breathed.

Teva moved. She didn't run; she flowed. She slipped through the gap and vanished into the fog on the other side.

"Benal. Go."

Benal scrambled, limbs flailing. He caught his fieldpack on a splinter of the rotted log. He froze, stifling a gasp.

Keo was on him. He grabbed Benal's arm, steadied him, and shoved him through the gap. Benal stumbled and fell to his knees on the other side.

Keo looked back one last time. The sleeping tree houses were invisible, lost in the mist. The guilt was a stone in his gut.

I'm sorry.

He put his hand on Noli’s back. Now. With me.

He pushed the command, and together they slipped through the gap. Keo had to physically drag the dromaeosaur the last few inches, her claws scoring the wood, her mind screaming No while his screamed Go.

Then they were through.

The stifling air of the jungle enveloped them. The wall of noise that Benal had dreaded slammed into Keo. It wasn't just noise. It was a million living things, screaming, hunting, breeding, and dying, all at once.

The fog was a blessing, a shroud that cut visibility to three meters.

"This way," Keo whispered. He looked to Teva. She closed her eyes for a second, orienting to the north by the pull in her bones, then pointed into the mist. Keo nodded and took point.

They moved in silence, ghosts in the mist. Ten meters. Fifty. A hundred. The soft mulch of the village floor was gone, replaced by sucking mud and treacherous roots. The unreality of it pressed in on Keo—they were outside. At night. Un-suiting-himself, a hubristic fool.

Benal, a tall, wavering shadow, stopped dead.

"Keo." The whisper was a tinny hiss from his suit's collar.

"Keep moving."

"Shh." Benal’s camouflaged head was cocked, his body rigid. His suit was filtering the insect-thrum, leaving only the new sound. "Listen."

Keo went still, the pressure in his head from holding Noli making it hard to focus. He quieted his mind, letting his own senses stretch. He heard the drip of water. The thrum of insects.

And something else.

A bone-dry click. Like a river stone struck against bone.

It was close. No. Not just close. It was moving.

Acheroraptor.

Keo went cold. He put a hand on Noli’s back. The dromaeosaur had gone rigid, head up and feathers flat.

"Don't." He wasn't just talking to Noli. He was talking to all of them. "Don't. Move."
