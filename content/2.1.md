Keo stood by the northern palisade. The perfume of flowers and the tang of cycad mulch pressed hot and wet. Beyond the logs, the jungle formed a wall of noise.

He tuned it out. He focused on the creature at his feet.

Noli’s feathers ruffled, her head-crest flattening as she tasted the air. The pheromone barrier.

Keo smelled its musky trace, too. But his senses pushed further. He tasted the dust of a ceratops herd kilometers off and felt the deep, contrabass thunder of a lone saropo far to the west. He didn't need Noli to be his eyes and ears. He just needed her to listen.

Still, he thought.

He didn't speak. He pushed the command. A simple spike of intent, a thread of mental projection that felt like flexing a muscle behind his eyes.

Noli’s head snapped toward him. Her yellow eye, round and sharp as a flybeak's, held his. The instinct to bolt, to hunt, to flee—it was all there, coiled under the feathers. But his will was a cold, smooth stone in her mind.

Sit.

She fought it for a second. Her sickle-claw twitched. Then, with a bird-like huff, she lowered her haunches.

Keo let out his breath. "Good."

The word was for him, not for her. The silence from the village core was louder than the jungle. All morning, no one had met his eyes. The adults wilted, their heads down.

Paralysis. The thought soured in his stomach.

Alira’s death. The kiva’s dimming lights. The fear. It clung to the Safe Zone like mud.

Keo scrubbed a hand over his face. He whistled, a two-note sound. Noli sprang up.

"It's fine," he whispered, more to himself than the dromaeosaur. He needed to do something, not brood. "Everything will be fine. The Keepers will fix it."

He believed it. Mostly.

He gave Noli a shove. "Go on. Hunt."

He pushed the release command, severing the link. The pressure behind his eyes vanished. Noli shook, as if waking up, and vanished into the groves, a feathered blur.

Keo turned his back on the perimeter. He was strong. He was fast. He wasn't afraid. He would not be paralyzed.
