# Cretaceous - Writing Style Guide (v1)

## Overall Tone and Prose Rhythm

The novel's tone is YA Survival Thriller. It is immediate, tense, and psychologically focused. The prose is "close" to the characters, prioritizing their physical sensations (fear, hunger, pain) and emotional reactions over complex, abstract philosophy.

Prose: The narrative voice is simple, direct, and concrete. It follows the Hemingway "iceberg" principle: 90% of the emotion and meaning is submerged, implied by the 10% (the action and simple words) on the surface.

Rule: Clarity and Impact over Eloquence. Avoid "flowery" or multi-syllable "SAT" words (like incongruous or ephemeral). Use "sharp," "cold," "dark," "fast" -- or even better, "razored", "icy", "black", "lightning" (these are not big words, but they're far more vivid). Verbs must be strong and active. Strive for verbs and nouns that imply adjectives and adverbs; avoid unnecessary adjectives and adverbs like the plague: the hero doesn't "swim quickly through the water" -- she "slices through". This will make the very occasional use of an adjective or adverb more powerful. Avoid passive tense.

Rhythm: The rhythm is tense and propulsive. It should feel immediate, like The Hunger Games.

Rule: Use sentence structure to control tension. Use longer, flowing sentences for brief moments of internal thought or environmental description. Judiciously use short, clipped, staccato sentences during action, fear, or high-tension scenes (e.g., the croc crossing, the Quetzalcoatlus attack). In exposition, make incomplete sentences rare. Vary sentence length.

## Point of View (POV)

The novel uses a Strict Third-Person Limited POV that rotates between key characters (Keo, Teva, Benal) by scene.

Deep Immersion: When in a character's POV, the narrative is fully embedded in their head. We only know what they are seeing, hearing, thinking, and feeling.

No Head-Hopping: This is the most crucial, inviolable rule. The narrative never reveals the thoughts or feelings of another character within a POV scene. We only know what the POV character can see (another's facial expression, a flinch) or assume.

Purpose: This strict separation is the primary engine for dramatic irony (we know Keo's crush, Teva doesn't) and character development (we feel Benal's internal terror, which contradicts his quiet exterior).

## Diction and World-Building

This is the central challenge: balancing a simple style with a complex world.

World-Building Integration (Context First): The novel's "drift" terms (yazhi, kiva, croc, saropo, old-tech) must be integrated through context, not exposition. The narrative never stops to explain.

Example: "The yazhi cried, and Teva picked up the child." (Implies yazhi = child).

Example: "Keo checked his spear. It was just old-tech... just metal. But it was all he had." (Implies old-tech = metal, not bio-engineered).

The "Exposition Valve" (AI Second): For highly complex sci-fi/temporal concepts, we will save the exposition for Beats 11-12. The Genesis Site AI will function as a "Watson," allowing for diegetic explanation in simple, clear terms, fulfilling the user's suggestion.

Sensory Language: This is key to the "survival" feel. Focus on primal, concrete senses.

Smell: The "rot" of the swamp, the "burnt ozone" of the Archive, "parched dust" from the skiff.

Touch: "Mud-slicked" clothes, "clinging" mud, the "slick" skin of the snake, the "maddening" stingburn.

Sound: The "click" of a razortail's claw, the "distant, bass thump" of a saropo, the "screech" of the Quetzalcoatlus.

## Dialogue Handling

Dialogue is fast, naturalistic, and often fragmented. It is a primary tool for characterization and pacing.

Tags: Dialogue tags are "invisible." The primary tag is "said." Flashy verbs ("exclaimed," "opined") are forbidden. More often, tags are replaced with action beats.

Example: Teva slammed the tablet on the table. "You were wrong."

Subtext: The most important part of the dialogue is the subtext. What a character says is often a mask for what they feel.

Keo's mask: Bravado ("We'll be fine.")

Teva's mask: Rage ("It doesn't matter.")

Benal's mask: Quiet, intellectual precision.

Fragmented Speech: Dialogue does not need to be in complete sentences. It should be clipped, realistic, and interrupted by action, breath, or thought.

Example: "Did you see that?" Keo whispered. "The sky—" / "Shut up. Don't move."

## Handling of Sensitive Content

No swearing, No graphic descriptions of gore, sex, or nudity: This is a firm rule. Harsh events occur, and the harshness must come through, but not by showing graphic acts in a voyeuristic way. This is not a horror novel or a steamy romance. To keep some of the immediacy of show-vs-tell, show reactions. For example, express extreme emotion (anger, despair) through physical action (Keo's reckless climb, Teva's accusation), sharp dialogue, or visceral internal monologue.

Noli's Death (Beat 7): We will show the shock of the attack and Keo's grief-stricken silence, and perhaps say that Noli was swallowed violently, but we will not describe how blood dripped and spattered as Noli is torn apart.

Keo's Injury (Beat 8): We will focus on his pain, his vulnerability, and Teva's exhaustion in treating him, not on a clinical description of the wound.

## Backstory and Memories (No Flashbacks)

The novel will never use a traditional, full-chapter flashback. The narrative must always move forward.

Mechanism 1: Archival Fragments (Epigraphs): As defined in the scene list, these brief snippets of "modern-day" news/logs will provide objective context (the pandemic, the mission) before major chapter blocks.

Mechanism 2: Temporal Flashes (Active, Diegetic): As defined in the scene list (Beats 8, 10, 12, 14), these are not memories. They are events that happen to the characters in the present tense. They are the only tool for delivering the subjective, emotional backstory of the "Noble Lie" and the schism.

## Anachronisms and Logic errors
Be careful to only use metaphors and similes that would be understandable to the people who think them. Hawks were not known 66mya, so Keo can't think that a predator is watching them like a hawk. An early draft of a scene by an AI said Keo's senses were sharper than a dinosaur's, because he could smell a pheromone barrier around the Safe Zone; this makes no sense, because such a barrier would be erected specifically because dinosaurs can smell it. Make sure things make sense in the context.

## Style Triage: The 'Common Prose' Filter
Before any draft is proposed to me, it MUST be filtered rigorously to raise its quality. Take this seriously; your default prose will not be good enough, and a lazy pass with the filter will not be enough; I'll waste lots of time giving you feedback. The goal is to replace "common" or "easy" prose with prose that is concrete, sensory, and active, with all obvious or unnecessary detail removed so its focus is razor-sharp.

### Hunt Down Lazy Adjectives and Adverbs
Bad writing -- which you MUST avoid -- is strongly correlated with the overuse of adjectives and adverbs. It uses clichéd, hackneyed phrases (heavy silence, perfectly still, sharp cry, single unique, many varied). It inserts modifiers that are weak or redundant, or that compensate for a boring, vague noun or verb that follows. You will have been trained on bad writing, and it is full of this antipattern. Beware. You must be radically, consistently better. Think Hemingway and EB White. Every word counts -- often in multiple ways. Less is more. An adjective+noun should often be replaced with a stronger noun: "sharp sound" -> "creak". Same for verb+adverb: "coughed wetly" -> "gurgled". Context often makes an adjective obvious. If we're in a cave, standing on limestone, we know the stone against our feet is cold; that's the nature of rocks in limestone caves. If we just said it's noon in a jungle after a rain, using "steamy" to modify "air" is stating the obvious. Adding adjectives to nouns, and adverbs to verbs slows the reader down and forces them to continuously reconcile their mental model against the text; it's an antipattern. Be particularly suspicious if you see more than one adjective or adverb stacked together.

This is not to say that adjectives and adverbs are bad. They're precious. They should be rare, so they land with greater impact when they're used.

Beware overuse of boring intensifiers like "much" and "very" and quantifiers like "all" or "some".

Beware overuse of "the"; it makes what it modifies specific; often specifity is unnecessary.

Counterexample (Common): Teva stood on the cave's cold stone floor.

Example (Target): Stone sapped heat from Teva's feet. (Moves from a generic descriptor to a direct physical sensation, pulling us closer to the POV. "The" is gone; it added nothing.)

Counterexample (Common): She saw the dark purple line on the yazhi's arm.

Example (Target): A bruising line snaked up the yazhi's arm. (Replaces two weak adjectives with one powerful, evocative participle and an active verb).

Counterexample (Common): The kiva became perfectly still. The silence hung heavy.

Example (Target): Rattling breath subsided into stillness. Silence pressed. (Useless uses of "the" are gone. The adverb is gone. The cliché "heavy silence" is replaced with a concrete, sensory metaphor that fits the location).

7.3. Vary Sentence Rhythm
Do not overuse staccato sentences or fragments -- especially fragments. This is another conceit of bad writers. Use staccato for impact, but surround it with simple or compound sentences to create a varied, propulsive rhythm.

Counterexample (Monotonous): The colors were dying. The light failed. The alcoves were dim. They were supposed to glow. A terrible sign.

Example (Target): The colors were dying. Teva watched the light leak from limestone alcoves as sick, muddy flickers. They were supposed to glow. (Combines sentences, which makes the final short fragment hit harder).

7.4. Use Active, Specific Verbs
Replace weak verbs (was, had, went, looked) with verbs that do the descriptive work themselves.

Counterexample (Common): Rano's voice was loud in the quiet room.

Example (Target): Rano's voice cracked in the stillness. (The verb "cracked" implies the emotion and the volume, while "stillness" is stronger than "quiet room").

Counterexample (Common): A sound came from Elara's throat.

Example (Target): A groan tore Elara's throat. (The noun and the verb are both upgraded).

Counterexample (Common): He whistled, a sharp, two-note sound.

Example (Target): He double-whistled. OR He whistled two notes. (Whistling is inherently sharp.).

Counterexample (Common): The sound was a low, bass rumble.
Example (Target): Bass shook the ground. (Low/bass are redundant. Showing the effect is more powerful than saying "rumble").

Counterexample (Common): The adults were sad, their heads down.
Example (Target): The adults wilted.

Counterexample (Common): The air was damp and heavy.
Example (Target): The air steamed.

## Misc
Put a space before and after an em dash.
Follow the British convention of only placing punctuation inside of quotes if the punctation is part of what was quoted.
