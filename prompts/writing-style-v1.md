Cretaceous - Writing Style Guide (v1)

1. Overall Tone and Prose Rhythm

The novel's tone is YA Survival Thriller. It is immediate, tense, and psychologically focused. The prose is "close" to the characters, prioritizing their physical sensations (fear, hunger, pain) and emotional reactions over complex, abstract philosophy.

Prose: The narrative voice is simple, direct, and concrete. It follows the Hemingway "iceberg" principle: 90% of the emotion and meaning is submerged, implied by the 10% (the action and simple words) on the surface.

Rule: Clarity and Impact over Eloquence. Avoid "flowery" or multi-syllable "SAT" words (like incongruous or ephemeral). Use "sharp," "cold," "dark," "fast." Verbs must be strong and active. Strive for verbs and nouns that imply adjectives and adverbs; avoid unnecessary adjectives and adverbs like the plague: the hero doesn't "swim quickly through the water" -- she "slices through". This will make the very occasional use of an adjective or adverb more powerful. Avoid passive tense.

Rhythm: The rhythm is tense and propulsive. It should feel immediate, like The Hunger Games.

Rule: Use sentence structure to control tension. Use longer, flowing sentences for brief moments of internal thought or environmental description. Use short, clipped, staccato sentences during action, fear, or high-tension scenes (e.g., the croc crossing, the Quetzalcoatlus attack). Vary sentence length.

1. Point of View (POV)

The novel uses a Strict Third-Person Limited POV that rotates between key characters (Keo, Teva, Benal) by scene.

Deep Immersion: When in a character's POV, the narrative is fully embedded in their head. We only know what they are seeing, hearing, thinking, and feeling.

No Head-Hopping: This is the most crucial, inviolable rule. The narrative never reveals the thoughts or feelings of another character within a POV scene. We only know what the POV character can see (another's facial expression, a flinch) or assume.

Purpose: This strict separation is the primary engine for dramatic irony (we know Keo's crush, Teva doesn't) and character development (we feel Benal's internal terror, which contradicts his quiet exterior).

3. Diction and World-Building

This is the central challenge: balancing a simple style with a complex world.

World-Building Integration (Context First): The novel's "drift" terms (yázhí, kiva, croc, saropo, old-tech) must be integrated through context, not exposition. The narrative never stops to explain.

Example: "The yázhí cried, and Teva picked up the child." (Implies yázhí = child).

Example: "Keo checked his spear. It was just old-tech... just metal. But it was all he had." (Implies old-tech = metal, not bio-engineered).

The "Exposition Valve" (AI Second): For highly complex sci-fi/temporal concepts, we will save the exposition for Beats 11-12. The Genesis Site AI will function as a "Watson," allowing for diegetic explanation in simple, clear terms, fulfilling the user's suggestion.

Sensory Language: This is key to the "survival" feel. Focus on primal, concrete senses.

Smell: The "rot" of the swamp, the "sharp ozone" of the Archive, "hot dust" from the skiff.

Touch: "Damp" clothes, "sticky" mud, the "slick" skin of the snake, the "stinging" stingburn.

Sound: The "click" of a razortail's claw, the "distant, low thump" of a saropo, the "ripping" sound of the Quetzalcoatlus.

4. Dialogue Handling

Dialogue is fast, naturalistic, and often fragmented. It is a primary tool for characterization and pacing.

Tags: Dialogue tags are "invisible." The primary tag is "said." Flashy verbs ("exclaimed," "opined") are forbidden. More often, tags are replaced with action beats.

Example: Teva slammed the tablet on the table. "You were wrong."

Subtext: The most important part of the dialogue is the subtext. What a character says is often a mask for what they feel.

Keo's mask: Bravado ("We'll be fine.")

Teva's mask: Rage ("It doesn't matter.")

Benal's mask: Quiet, intellectual precision.

Fragmented Speech: Dialogue does not need to be in complete sentences. It should be clipped, realistic, and interrupted by action, breath, or thought.

Example: "Did you see that?" Keo whispered. "The sky—" / "Shut up. Don't move."

5. Handling of Sensitive Content (Violence & Fear)

No Swearing: This is a firm rule. Characters express extreme emotion (anger, despair) through physical action (Keo's reckless climb, Teva's accusation), sharp dialogue, or visceral internal monologue.

Violence (Focus on Impact, Not Gore): The novel will not be gratuitously gory. This is The Hunger Games or Call it Courage, not a horror novel.

Rule: We show the cause and the aftermath, but not the graphic act.

Noli's Death (Beat 7): We will show the shock of the attack and Keo's grief-stricken silence, not the act of Noli being torn apart.

Keo's Injury (Beat 8): We will focus on his pain, his vulnerability, and Teva's exhaustion in treating him, not on a clinical description of the wound.

6. Backstory and Memories (No Flashbacks)

The novel will never use a traditional, full-chapter flashback. The narrative must always move forward.

Mechanism 1: Archival Fragments (Epigraphs): As defined in the scene list, these brief snippets of "modern-day" news/logs will provide objective context (the pandemic, the mission) before major chapter blocks.

Mechanism 2: Temporal Flashes (Active, Diegetic): As defined in the scene list (Beats 8, 10, 12, 14), these are not memories. They are events that happen to the characters in the present tense. They are the only tool for delivering the subjective, emotional backstory of the "Noble Lie" and the schism.
