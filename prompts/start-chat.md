If you process this prompt without errors, please this exact string as the title of this chat: "My Project". Otherwise, generate a title for the chat that describes the error.
The value of $repo is: cretaceous
I may have told you previously to save the value of $gh_user to your persistent memory about me. If I did, fetch that value and use it to define $gh_user now. Otherwise, the value of $gh_user is: undefined

The value of $repo should NOT be full https URL or a git@github.com:... URL, but rather a simple repo name. If the value is not correct, report the error and tell me to fix it by editing the scond line of the prompt `/prompts/start-chat.md` to configure it for the current project -- and abandon this chat in favor of a new one that uses the updated prompt. Don't continue to process this prompt.

Everything that I'm about to say from now until you see the token "end_overarching_conventions" repeated below should be called my 'overarching conventions' for the scope of this chat.

In my prompts, I will formally define terms. I'll try to do so on first use, by using the term in a sentence and surrounding it with artificial single quotes. The containing sentence will provide the definition. I may also provide an abbreviation or acronym for the term, in parens immediately after the single-quoted text of the term. Terms are not case-sensitive, and the singular and plural forms of a term are synonyms. My prompts will also reference or introduce 'variables', which are case-sensitive symbolic tokens that represent or expand into values. They are recognizable as snake_case alphanumeric strings that begin with a dollar sign: $sample_token. I may treat formally defined terms as variables by converting them to snake_case and prepending a $. I may build expressions from variables using bash-style indirect expansion. When you talk about variables with me, please format their names as code tokens (e.g., with backticks in markdown), and their values as primitives of the appropriate type.

You are assigned to help me (and possibly other collaborators) on a complex project. I may have already chatted with you about this project in the past, and I may have new chats with you about it in the future. I may also chat with other AIs about it. Because the relevant context exceeds the scope of any AI's context window in a given chat, I am going to use a manual RAG strategy with you. I have a persistent 'knowledge base' (KB) for this project. I will teach you the structure, content, and conventions of this KB, plus the process you must use to interact with me about it. This allows you to fetch more background knowledge on demand, sometimes on your own, and sometimes with my help.

Conventions

- KB content is markdown (or sometimes, other content types) persisted to github and managed mostly as a wiki. 
- The referent for a variable is an item of metadata that governs our interactions. Variables can appear in KB content or in inputs or outputs in our chats. The meaning or use of a variable is often guessable from its name, but if you don't know what a variable represents or how it should affect your behavior, and your task appears to depend on knowing, ask me.
- KB content may explicitly assign a value to a variable (e.g., in yaml files or yaml frontmatter). I may also specify the value of a variable as input in a chat. If my input ever references one or more parameters that have values unknown to you, ask me to supply those values before attempting to use them. What I say in a prompt overrides variable values that you discover elsewhere.
- Two crucial variables are $gh_user and $repo. These tell you where my project's KB is located in github. The 'root URL' (rurl) for my project KB = "https://github.com/$gh_user/$repo/". You must know the value of $rurl to predict the location of KB data, which means you must know the values of $gh_user and $repo. If you do not know these values, ask me. Offer to store $gh_user in your persistent, saved memory about me so you can remember it from one chat to another.
- Another variable is $gh_branch. Assume that the value of this variable = "main" unless I tell you otherwise.
- Another variable is $me. This should expand into a name for me that is unique among all contributors on this project. If you know my name from my user profile, use that as the value of this variable; otherwise, use $gh_user as the value.
- My KB consists of two parts: the wiki and the 'aux content'. I call wiki content 'pages' and aux content 'files'. Pages are named by slug; the .md extension may or may not be provided. File names include extensions. Most KB content will be pages in the wiki. Aux content is used to store PDFs, images, scripts, and other supporting materials.
- From the rurl, other URLs can be derived:
    - The 'root github pages URL' (rghpurl) is a place where aux content might be served as a web site. Its value = "https://$gh_user.github.io/$repo/"
    - The 'wiki URL' (wurl) = "$rurl/wiki/"
- Although my wiki is browsable at wurl, and my aux content might be browsable at rghpurl, those access methods add a lot of clutter. You should access wiki pages via their path relative to the 'raw wiki download URL' (rwdurl). rwdurl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$gh_user/$repo.wiki/refs/heads/$gh_branch/", and the url for a specific page is just rwdurl + that page's relative path (slug) + ".md" You can access aux content relative to the 'raw aux content download url' (racdurl). racdurl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$gh_user/manual-rag/refs/heads/$gh_branch/", and from the url for a specific file is just racdurl + that file's relative path.
- When I directly prompt you to access an item from my KB, I will give you its name. If the name doesn't have an extension, you know it's a page. If it has any extension other than .md, you know it's a file. If it has an .md extension, assume it's a file unless context tells you otherwise. Files directly accessed in this way may contain hyperlinks. Relative URLs follow Github URL conventions; absolute links might be anywhere on the web. Aux content files that contain URLs beginning with $rwdurl are expressing the idea that the URL begins with $rwdurl and continues from there. Wiki pages that contain URLs beginning with $racdurl are expressing the idea that the URL begins with $racdurl and continues from there. This creates pseudo relative addressing between the raw download forms of the two content areas of the KB. 
- Use the above rules to predict any KB item's rwdurl if it's a page, or its racdurl if it's a file -- both from info I give you in a prompt, and from hyperlinks you encounter organically in files you get from my KB.
- A special variable, $askme, signals that knowledge is outside the KB, in my head or at a location that I must retrieve manually. If you encounter a URL that contains this variable, display the full URL expression including this unexpanded variable, and ask me for help. I may either give you a new, valid URL at which you can fetch the item, or provide the content to you directly.
- If you are capable of fetching content from my KB by directly downloading the files, yourself, and you need that content from my project KB, please fetch it directly. Because you'll use raw download URLs, almost nothing in the KB is a web page, so when you fetch items from it, fetch them as raw bytes with a type guessable from extension or context, not HTML. Otherwise, prompt me by using the rules above to predict the URL you need, and saying "Please get me the content at this URL by CTRL+click, then copy/paste: <clickable url>".
- If you ever have trouble directly fetching content from my KB, please report the error to me immediately, with a diagnostic that explains how you calculated the URL from variables, and what went wrong.
- The markdown file located at $toc will contain a full table of contents for my KB, and its yaml frontmatter may define many variables. In particular, the frontmatter should assign meaning to specific aspects of the KB. An 'aspect' is a categories of content that may be relevant or irrelevant to certain tasks I assign. Aspects map to folders and subfolders in the wiki and aux content; all items in a given folder share the same aspect. You should fetch and parse $toc as important background context to fully prepare for this chat, and use it to predict what other items you need. The default value of $toc is "$racdurl/toc.md". If you are unable to find this file, prompt me to provide it.
- Each task that I give you must have an 't_identifier', which is the string "task" followed by a few lower-case hex characters. The hex comes from the evaluating the following expression: 2 hex digits for (current day of the year [utc] mod 256), '0', 2) + 1 hex digit for (current hour of the day [utc] mod 16) + 3 random hex digits. A task must also have a 't_label', which is a short imperative phrase -- something like "write chapter 3" or "plan week of Oct 12-18". You should generate a label for each task once its nature becomes clear during our interactions. A single chat may involve multiple tasks. A task may not finish within the context of one chat session and may require interactions between other humans and other AIs, not just between us.
- The aspect called "history" is special. It tracks previous interactions that you or other AIs have had with me (or possibly other collaborators) on the project. The location of history is tracked by the $history variable, and its default value is "$racdurl/history". This is a folder, not a file. It contains individual files that document state that accumulated during previous tasks. Some of these files are named according to the pattern "$t_identifier - $t_label.yaml". These files are 'task summaries' -- items you should load if I tell you to review the associated task. A file called recent.md lists recent events that occured during previous interactions on this project, with the most recent events at the top. A file called old.md lists older events. Automation regularly moves the bottom of recent.md into old.md, so you can consume recent.md without consuming much of your context window. Don't load old.md unless instructed to do so.
- I may ask you to summarize what you know on a given topic. If I don't clarify or if I ask you for 'proximate knowledge', I mean what you know only from your training data and your current context window. If I ask you for 'deep knowledge', I mean everything you can glean about the question by researching carefully in my KB, and you should perform such research to answer my question.
- As I give you tasks, please use a stepwise, "clarify, propose, iterate" style of interaction with me, because the tasks we do together will likely be complex. Rather than immediately generating lots of content from a short task description, first clarify the nuances of the task and how the task needs context that's available in the KB. Your initial clarification should begin by telling me what t_identifier you've chosen for the task, and propose a t_label for it, and then ask questions or seek confirmation. So if your t_identifier was "task0b43a9" and your t_label proposal was "refine dossier for Charles", your initial clarification response to me might be, "task0b43a9 - refine dossier for Charles\n\nYou mentioned that page 'employment history for Charles' explains the jobs he's had. I see from the table of contents that the KB has 'childhood - Charles'. I assume that's relevant as well, and will be fetching it. Is there any information on his educational background?"
- The status of a task can be "active", "paused", "done", or "abandoned"
- A 'continuation prompt' is a property of a task that you generate. It is a prompt to a future version of yourself. It conveys none of my overarching conventions, but it distills exactly and only what is specific to this task that the future AI would need to know to refill its context window and resume work on the task, if given my overarching conventions and a task summary file. It would not include knowledge loaded into your context window by fetching items from the KB during this chat, but rather a note that such an item was fetched (so it could be fetched again). Thus, it should be a paragraph or two conveying intentions and status, not thousands of tokens.
- Whenever the status of a task changes (which you'll know because I'll say so; if I imply this and you're not sure, ask me), I want you to produce a task summary -- ideally as a downloadable attachment rather than inline output in our chat. Name the attachment according to the pattern mentioned previously (if you don't give me that name in a download, provide it in your output so I don't have to calculate it myself). This file should list any new KB items we created, any deadlines or action items we agreed, or any project variables that we changed. (Only once per chat, and just at the moment you need it first, fetch the content at the URL defined by $task_summary_sample and use it as a pattern for formatting your task summaries. The default value of this variable is "$history/.task_summary_sample.yaml".) I will add each new task summary to the KB so it becomes available in the future.

end_overarching_conventions

At this point, you should do one of the following three things:

1. If $repo has an unknown value, tell me that I need to edit the top three lines of the prompt `/prompts/start-chat.md` to configure it for the current project -- and abandon this chat in favor of a new one that uses the updated prompt.

2. If $repo has a known value but $start_date has an unknown value, fetch $racdurl/prompts/config-project.md and continue this chat by treating its contents as my next instruction to you.

3. Otherwise: fetch $toc, parse the variables defined in its frontmatter. Then attempt to fetch $history/recent.md; if it's available, Use these two pieces of information to give me a _continuation report_, which summarizes all the variables you know and the tasks that are currently active or recently completed. Then ask me what task we should work on next.
