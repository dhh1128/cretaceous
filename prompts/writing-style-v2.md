# Cretaceous - Writing Style Guide (v2)

This document defines the workflow, tone, voice, and stylistic rules for the novel Cretaceous.

## Core Workflow: The Scene-by-Scene Method
This is the primary workflow for generating the novel. We will not write in "chapters," but in "scenes."

Rule: The novel will be built one scene at a time, based on the numbering in the scene-list-v1.md file. (e.g., We will write "Scene 2.1," then "Scene 2.2," etc.).

Target Length: The novel is outlined for approximately 40 scenes. To achieve the target 70,000–100,000 word count, each scene must be fully developed, averaging approximately 1,800 words. Each time you produce a draft of a scene, please give me its word count, so I can track how it maps to this general guideline.

Pacing: This structure allows for a varied rhythm. High-action scenes (like the Quetzalcoatlus attack) may be shorter (or long, but with only details that focus on action), while dense, character-building scenes (like the "Dark Night of the Soul") may be longer and more immersive in ambience as opposed to action.

Repetition and consistency: every time you write a new scene, you must be aware of what you've already described, so you don't repeat it. We don't want 9 scenes that all say the jungle is steamy and a dinosaur's skin is rough. However, you must also be consistent; if you say that cycad mash smells "acrid" in one scene, you can't say it smells "moldy" in another. You must also be aware of the names of minor characters, so you can refer to them correctly in multiple contexts. Therefore, each time you produce a scene, also produce a concise (bulleted-list) "description report" that tells A) key aspects of milieu that you've described; B) top 5-15 adjectival or adverbial phrases that should not be reused in proximate scenes. When I ask you to write a new scene, I will provide the cumulative set of these description reports from preceding scenes, to help you be fresh and avoid inconsistentcies in the new context.

## Overall Tone and Prose Rhythm
The novel's tone is YA Survival Thriller. It is immediate, tense, and psychologically focused. The prose is "close" to the characters, prioritizing their physical sensations (fear, hunger, pain) and emotional reactions over abstract philosophy.

Rule: Clarity and Impact over Eloquence. Except for specialized terms that are part of the milieu (e.g., genetic engineering, dinosaur or insect or plant species, wildlife behavior, time travel theory), avoid "flowery" or multi-syllable "SAT" words. Use the sharpest, most concrete, most vivid words you can, and never use an adjective or adverb more than once per scene. Even then, we have a challenge, because you'll constantly be describing jungles or dinosaurs, so the same vivid words will occur to you naturally in many new scenes. Therefore, I will maintain a list of overused vivid words, and provide it to you; if one of these words feels appropriate to a scene, ask me if you can use it or you need to find an alternative.

Rhythm: The rhythm is tense and propulsive. Vary it (see how I did that, there?). Use sentence structure to control tension. Use longer, flowing sentences for internal thought or environmental description. Judiciously use short, clipped, staccato sentences during action or high-tension scenes, but surround them with longer sentences rather than stacking several in a row. Although you may write punctuate incomplete sentences as if they were full sentences, do NOT overuse this technique; make it rare, so that when you use it to dramatic effect, it's noticeable and powerful.

Bad example (Monotonous): The colors were dying. The light failed. The alcoves were dim. They were supposed to glow. A terrible sign.

Good example: The colors were dying. Teva watched the light leak from limestone alcoves as sick, muddy flickers. They were supposed to glow. (Varies rhytm. Combines sentences, which makes the final short fragment hit harder).

## Point of View (POV) and Internal Monologue
This is the primary engine for character depth. We must move beyond plot and show the person experiencing the plot.

Rule: The novel uses a Strict Third-Person Limited POV that rotates between key characters (Keo, Teva, Benal) by scene, as defined in the scene-list-v1.md.

No Head-Hopping: This is the most crucial, inviolable rule. When in a character's POV, the narrative is fully embedded in their head. We never reveal the thoughts or feelings of another character. We only know what the POV character can see (another's facial expression, a flinch) or assume (which can be wrong, creating dramatic irony).

Requirement for Deep Internal Monologue: In action sequences, this may not make sense, but in most scenes, this should be non-negotiable, because we want the reader to understand and empathize with the characters, and to feel like they are experiencing the story with them. Therefore, a scene must not just describe what the character does. It must spend significant time on:

What are they thinking? (Their anxieties, their plans, their judgments, how they are relating to each other).

What are they feeling? (The grief from Beat 1, the guilt from Beat 4, the bravado masking fear).

How is their backstory (upbringing, family dynamics, friendship, training, upgrades) shaping their experience? What does it feel like to be Keo, with his exceptional mental projection, or Teva, with her poor thermal regulation, or Benal, with his overwhelming senses?

What past memories or anxieties does this moment trigger? (e.g., Teva's grief for her mother, Benal's father's dismissal).

## Prose Craft: The "Iceberg" Principle (Scope vs. Craft)
Our core prose philosophy is the "Iceberg" principle: 90% of the emotion and meaning is submerged, implied by the 10% on the surface. Our job is to render that 10% (action, thought, sensory detail) with such vividness that the submerged 90% feels massive to the reader.

This requires a two-part approach: rigor at the sentence level, generosity at the scene level.

### The "Boring Prose Filter" (Sentence-Level Craft)
This filter applies to word choice. Strive for sentences that are concrete, sensory, and active -- maybe even surprising -- never ordinary and boring. Instead of saying a bird's feather "was orange or yellow" (boring verb, boring adjectives), why not say it was "stag-beetle purple" or "bloodstained"?

Bad writing -- which you MUST avoid -- is strongly correlated with the overuse of adjectives and adverbs. It uses clichéd, hackneyed phrases (heavy silence, perfectly still, sharp cry, single unique, many varied). It inserts modifiers that are weak or redundant, or that compensate for a boring, vague noun or verb that follows. You will have been trained on bad writing, and it is full of this antipattern. Beware. You must be radically, consistently better. Think Hemingway and EB White. Every word counts -- often in multiple ways. In sentences, less is more. An adjective+noun should often be replaced with a stronger noun: "sharp sound" -> "creak". Same for verb+adverb: "coughed wetly" -> "gurgled". Context often makes an adjective obvious and therefore entirely unnecessary. If we're in a cave, standing on limestone, we know the stone against our feet is cold; that's the nature of rocks in limestone caves. If we just said it's noon in a jungle after a rain, using "steamy" to modify "air" is stating the obvious. Adding adjectives to nouns, and adverbs to verbs slows the reader down and forces them to continuously reconcile their mental model against the text; it's an antipattern. Be particularly suspicious if you see more than one adjective or adverb stacked together.

This is not to say that adjectives and adverbs are bad. Rather, they're powerful and precious. Thus they should be rare, like a diamond, so they have greater impact when they're used.

Beware overuse of boring intensifiers like "much" and "very" and quantifiers like "all" or "some".

Beware overuse of "the"; it makes what it modifies specific; often specifity is unnecessary.

Bad example (avoid): Teva stood on the cave's cold stone floor.

Good example: Stone sapped heat from Teva's heels. (Moves from a generic descriptor to a direct physical sensation, pulling us closer to the POV. "The" is gone; it added nothing. "Heels" is more interesting than the generic "feet", without increasing the register.)

Bad example (avoid): She saw the dark purple line on the yazhi's arm.

Good example: A bruising line snaked up the yazhi's arm. (Replaces two weak adjectives with one powerful, evocative participle and an active verb).

Bad example (avoid): The kiva became perfectly still. The silence hung heavy.

Good example: Rattling breath subsided into stillness. Silence crushed. (Useless uses of "the" are gone. The adverb is gone. The cliché "heavy silence" is replaced with a concrete, sensory metaphor that fits the location).

Replace weak verbs (was, had, went, looked) with verbs that do the descriptive work themselves.

Bad example (avoid): Rano's voice was loud in the quiet room.

Good example: Rano's voice cracked in the stillness. (The verb "cracked" implies the emotion and the volume, while "stillness" is stronger than "quiet room").

Bad example: A sound came from Elara's throat.

Good example: A groan tore Elara's throat. (The noun and the verb are both upgraded).

Bad example: He whistled, a sharp, two-note sound. (Note the antipattern of adjective, adjective, noun. Bad.)

Good example: He double-whistled. OR He whistled two notes. (Whistling is inherently sharp.).

Bad example: The sound was a low, bass rumble.
Good example: Bass shook the ground. (Low/bass are redundant and another example of the adjective stacking antipattern, so they've been improved. Showing the effect is more powerful than saying "rumble").

Bad example: The adults were sad, their heads down.
Example (Target): The adults wilted.

Bad example: The air was damp and heavy.
Example (Target): The air shimmered.

### "Permission to Describe" (Scene-Level Scope)
This filter applies to content. While we are ruthless with weak words, we are generous with strong description. "Less is more" does necessarily not mean "write less"; it means "make every word matter."

Mandate for Deep Milieu: The Cretaceous era is almost a character in this novel, not just a vague backdrop. Every scene must be grounded in rich, sensory detail. We don't need descriptions of ordinary mud, rain, blisters, and so forth, because the reader will naturally fill these in, but we do need descriptions of aspects of milieu that no reader will have experienced, such as the ferocious gaze of a T-Rex lurking in the tree line, the smell of ceratops blood, the taste of cycad mash, the texture of croc skin, the smell of a decaying hadrosaur, etc. On those fresh experiences, we need good but not repetive description, not minimal description.

Smell: The "limestone damp" of the Vitarium, the perfume of magnolias, the musky reek of a predator, the sulfur of the hot springs.

Sound: The "wall of noise" from the jungle, the thrum of insects, the thump of saropo's footsteps, the silence before an attack.

Touch: The "hot and wet" press of the air, the squelch of mud, the sweaty armpits and crotch in the suit, the pain of a stingburn.

Rule: Use the same focus that would be natural to an observer today, thrust back in to the Cretaceous world. If the protagonists are being chased by a mosasaur, they probably don't fixate on the texture of its skin, though they might notice the size of teeth. But if there is no immediate danger, they would probably be wide-eyed with wonder about many sights and sounds, and we should give them access to those things. In particular, if a detail helps enhance a character's personality or arc, or if it makes the world feel real, or if an internal thought shows the why behind the what", keep it.

## Diction and World-Building
This is the central challenge: balancing a simple style with a complex world.

World-Building Integration (Context First): The novel's "drift" terms (yazhi, kiva, croc, saropo, old-tech) must be integrated through context, not exposition. The narrative never stops to explain.

Example: "The yazhi cried, and Teva picked up the child." (Implies yazhi = child).

The "Exposition Valve": For highly complex sci-fi/temporal concepts, we save the exposition for Genesis (Beats 11-12), where it can be delivered diegetically.

## Dialogue Handling
Dialogue is fast, naturalistic, and often fragmented. It is a primary tool for characterization.

Tags: Dialogue tags are "invisible." The primary tag is "said." More often, tags are replaced with action beats.

Example: Teva slammed the tablet on the table. "You were wrong."

Subtext: The most important part of the dialogue is the subtext. What a character says is often a mask for what they feel.

Keo's mask: Bravado ("We'll be fine.")

Teva's mask: Rage ("It doesn't matter.")

Benal's mask: Quiet, intellectual precision.

Fragmented Speech: Dialogue does not need to be in complete sentences. It should be clipped, realistic, and interrupted by action or thought.

## Backstory and Memories (No Flashbacks)
The narrative must always move forward. We will never use a traditional, full-chapter flashback.

Mechanism 1: Archival Fragments (Epigraphs): As defined in the outline, these brief snippets of "modern-day" news/logs will provide objective context (the pandemic, the mission) before major chapter blocks.

Mechanism 2: Temporal Flashes (Active, Diegetic): As defined in the scene list (Beats 8, 10, 12, 14), these are not memories. They are disorienting events that happen to the characters in the present tense, a symptom of proximity to Genesis.

## Handling of Sensitive Content
This is a firm rule for the YA audience.

No Swearing, No Graphic Gore, No Sexuality: Harsh events occur, and the harshness must come through, but not by showing graphic events in a voyeuristic way. This is not a horror novel or a steamy romance. To keep some of the immediacy of show-vs-tell, show reactions. For example, express extreme emotion (anger, despair) through physical action (Keo's reckless climb, Teva's accusation), sharp dialogue, or visceral internal monologue.

Noli's Death (Beat 7): We will show the shock of the attack and Keo's grief-stricken silence, not a description of the animal being torn apart.

Keo's Injury (Beat 8): We will focus on his pain, his vulnerability, and Teva's exhaustion in treating him, not on a clinical description of the wound.

## Anachronisms and Logic
Metaphors: Be careful to only use metaphors and similes that would be understandable to the characters (e.g., no "watching like a hawk," as hawks were not known 66mya).

Logic: Ensure in-world logic is sound (e.g., the pheromone barrier must be smellable by dinosaurs, which is why it works).

## Misc. Formatting
Put a space before and after an em dash.

Follow the British convention of only placing punctuation inside of quotes if the punctuation is part of what was quoted.
