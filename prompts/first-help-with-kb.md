I'd like you to help me on a novel-writing project. This will take many prompts, across multiple chats spanning weeks or months; I'm not expecting that to be completed today. What I'd like you to help me do today is create some reference materials that I can upload into later prompts as context, in a RAG strategy.

The novel I want to write is young adult sci-fi, and has a working title of "Cretaceous". Its background premise is that in the near future, mankind discovers the ability to travel in time just before they also discover a pending extinction-level event (giant meteor about to strike the earth). Because these two events happen at nearly the same time, the full ramifications of time travel have not had time for deep scientific or ethical study to work its way through society, and time travel is still usable only by government scientists with near-infinite budgets and strong secrecy. And because there appears to be no way to prevent the pending apocalypse, a desperate response is conceived: send a small group of designated survivors back in time. No time in the near past is deemed safe (potential paradoxes are not fully understood), and highly precise targeting is not yet possible, anyway, so instead, these designated survivors are sent back in time to the cretaceous period, exactly at the location of the Chicxulub crater. The thinking is that these people will have time (perhaps as long as a few thousand years, perhaps less, depending on the precision of their targeting) before the dinosaur-ending meteor arrives to study temporal science, living at a place at which all traces of their existence will be obliterated from history so no paradoxes can occur. Hopefully these people can then figure out whether it's possible to jump forward in time to help humanity avert their own crisis 65 million years later, and by the time they do, they'll be able to explain the rules for being safe from side effects in time travel.

Against this background premise, the intent is to write a coming-of-age novel where a young man who has grown up among the survivor group, a couple hundred years after they arrive in the past, declares independence from some of the strictures imposed by that unique society, learns to think for himself, questions tradition, and has a survival adventure (abandoning his home to find the forbidden location of first arrival that might be outside the center point of impact for the meteor -- having to travel and live on his own, outside the support circle of his people). The survival aspect will be brutal, because living in Yucatan jungle during the Cretaceous era would be extremely dangerous. In this arc, I want this character to have to dig deep in his own heart, exert courage, confront his demons, and grow up. I also want him to learn nuance -- that not all issues are black and white, and that people are precious and worthy of love even if they are imperfect. Some notable influences that I'd like to channel include "Call it Courage" by Armstrong Sperry, "Dune" by Frank Herbert, and "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins.

I'd like to build a very rich world for this book, and I'd like the length of the novel to be 70k to 100k words, targeted at a 10th grade reading level. The book should have 4 or 5 interesting characters besides the main one. In particular, I'd like the boy to travel with two friends nearly his own age, a boy and a girl. Their conversations and interactions while they struggle to survive and remain united, and while they parse their society's traditions and the motivations of their parents, should help advance the narrative arc of their maturation from teens into young and more independent and nuanced young adults.

I want this to be a novel with an extremely strong and unique milieu, and to some extent, I want the milieu to provide a part of the story -- just like Alice travels through the looking glass and comes back or Gulliver experiences numerous strange worlds on his travels, I want the story to be fascinating just as an immersion into a world that is unlike anything the reader has seen before.

I also want there to be some mystery. The concerns that modern scientists had in choosing this solution for the apocalypse have no known resolution to the society of designated survivors, because they experience problems in transit and lost some knowledge and most of their ability to perform high science on their arrival -- for centuries as the story begins, they've been in survival mode, under a prohibition on distant travel lest they stray outside the boundaries of the impact zone for the Chicxulub asteroid. The main character determines to risk travel back to the site of original arrival, not knowing what he will find. (The resolution of this novel will be that he and his friends arrive and discover that some of their assumptions about society's rules are false traditions, and that time is ticking on finding a solution, because the asteroid will be arriving in about a decade. This sets up sequels.)

I also want to inject a bit of magical realism/fantasy. Posit that one of the surprising effects of time travel is a slight shift in the brain waves of humans, such that they have limited ability to detect the thoughts of nearby people and animals, and also a limited ability to influence animals (e.g., to tame a triceratops in a limited way, allowing them to ride on its back for a while until they are too tired to maintain control); this could be a survival skill.

Now, here are some questions for you:

1. What background research might be necessary (e.g., conditions in the Yucatan 65 million years ago; common dinosaur species, climate; terminology related to asteroids and time travel)?

2. What worldbuilding artifacts might be needed (e.g., map, teenage slang, tools, social customs)?

3. How can you help me develop an outline?

4. How can you help me develop a dossier on each character? What should go in it to make characters maximally interesting?

5. What questions should I answer now, that will help guide the writing of the whole novel? (longer plot arcs, timeline, sources of conflict and progression to a climax, narrative voice, etc.)?

6. I am planning on persisting my prompts and the artifacts that I develop in a github repo as markdown files, so I can easily bring them back to you in a RAG strategy. What advice do you have for me about doing that well?

I know that's a lot of questions. Please provide your answers in concise/maximally terse form, as bulleted lists of plain text. Also, suggest an order in which we can work together on the project artifacts.
