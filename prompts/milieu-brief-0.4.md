# Cretaceous - Milieu Reference v0.4

## Core Premise
YA sci-fi novel, 70-100k words, 10th grade reading level. Near-future humanity discovers time travel simultaneously with discovering pending extinction-level **biological pandemic**. Desperate solution: send designated survivors (scientists, soldiers, experts) back to Cretaceous period, 66 million years ago, to Chicxulub impact site (Yucatan). Mission: develop biological solution to future pandemic, study temporal mechanics, and transmit solution forward in time to save humanity. Constraints: must remain within future impact radius to avoid leaving evidence/paradoxes. Original group arrives **206 years before novel begins**. Transit problems caused knowledge loss, equipment damage. Society has been in survival mode since.

## Temporal Mechanics & Mission Status

**The biological solution:** ALREADY DEVELOPED. The upgrade system IS the solution - the colonists solved the pandemic problem within the first generation after arrival. The viral vector technology that delivers upgrades can be adapted to cure/prevent the future pandemic.

**The remaining problem:** **Temporal mechanics for forward time travel**. Original scientists hadn't fully solved how to travel forward in time safely. The equipment exists at Genesis Site but requires understanding they don't have. If Keo and friends can solve the temporal mechanics questions, they can save future Earth. **This revelation comes at the end of the first novel and sets up the sequel.**

**What went wrong:** 
- Transit damaged equipment, killed some arrivals
- Lost critical knowledge about forward time travel mechanics
- Society developed hard-tech aversion over generations
- Mission understanding corrupted: now believe they must somehow "send" solution forward (bury it? orbital artifact?) rather than physically travel WITH the solution
- Timeline belief: Society thinks they have centuries; reality is 2-3 decades
- Asteroid uncertainty: Multiple asteroids detected on potential collision courses; exact impactor unknown

**Faction split:**
- **Traditionalists** (majority, includes leadership): Temporal paradoxes are real/dangerous. Must stay in impact zone, minimize hard tech, preserve mission, perfect biological solution.
- **Branchers** (significant minority, includes Benal's parents): Time travel created branched timeline. Nothing they do affects "their" future. More willing to use hard tech, explore beyond boundaries, question mission relevance.

## Society Structure

**Population:** 900-1000 people (high infant mortality, some upgrades reduce fertility)

**Origins:** Original colonists primarily from White Sands, New Mexico area - mix of Latino/Mexican, Native American (Navajo, Pueblo), and diverse military/scientific personnel from around the world. Created diverse gene pool and linguistic influences.

**Governance:** Council of elders, elected by all adults annually. Members often serve long terms, but position is not permanent (health, age, political alliances can force turnover). Council makes major decisions, manages resources, mediates disputes.

**Location:** Settled ~80km inland from Genesis Site in safe zone on slightly elevated, drier ground than surrounding wetlands. Reasons for migration from Genesis Site: fresh water, caves (stable temperature for Vitarium), defensible terrain, resources, escape from harsh coastal conditions and temporal disorientation effects.

**The Safe Zone:** 
- **Size:** 2-4 km diameter (~3-12 km²)
- **Village core** (~0.5 km diameter): Tree houses (protection from ground threats) with roofed structures (protect from aerial threats like pterosaurs), central gathering spaces, Vitarium kiva nearby
- **Cultivated zone** (~1-1.5 km radius from center): Food crops, managed groves, insect farms
- **Managed buffer zone** (outer ring to 2-4 km edge): Patrolled boundaries, grazing areas for small domesticated herbivore herd, barriers
- **Perimeter defenses:** Physical barriers (planted trees, fences, natural features like rivers and rock ridges), carefully maintained to exclude large herbivores and carnivores

**Security measures:**
- Constant boundary patrols by watchers (scouts/lookouts)
- Buddy system ingrained in culture - MANDATORY near water
- Mental projection used to discourage animal approach
- Tree houses provide secondary defense layer
- River barriers (underwater palisades - wooden stakes driven deep, stone weirs creating shallow rapids, multiple redundant layers, netting) against crocs (crocodilians) - MAJOR ongoing threat
- Regular inspection and repair crews for barriers
- Roofed structures protect against aerial threats (flybeaks - pterosaurs, primarily scavengers but dangerous to children)
- Any croc that breaches perimeter is killed immediately
- Cultural practices: "water is death" mentality, never turn back on water, children (yazhi) never near water unsupervised, water-fetching is communal and heavily guarded
- Acceptance that barriers aren't perfect - occasional breaches occur (~5-10 people per year lost to croc attacks, mostly from protocol violations)

**Domesticated animals:**
- **Working herbivores** (5-10 hadrosaurs - duck-billed dinosaurs, 2-4 tons each, herd animals, herbivores): Kept inside safe zone, heavily supplemented with cultivated food. Used for heavy labor (moving boulders, uprooting trees, damming waterways, processing cycads). Mental projection required to direct them.
- **Semi-wild herds:** Additional hadrosaurs graze outside safe zone but nearby. Explorers (like Keo's parents) with strong mental projection periodically venture out to "recruit" animals for temporary labor, then release them.
- **Limited bird domestication:** Possibly ground-dwelling species (skybirds) kept for ovos (eggs)
- **Note:** Cretaceous mammals all too small (rabbit-sized maximum - grounders, small burrowing mammal-like reptiles) for useful domestication

**Daily life - Food sources:**

*Cultivated staple crops:*
- Palm groves (fruits, palm hearts, starchy pith for flour - pan when baked)
- Fig relatives (reliable fruit producers, stonefruits)
- Cycad plantations (labor-intensive processing for starch/flour, high yield - hadrosaurs help with grinding/processing)
- Fern gardens (fiddleheads, rhizomes, glassleaf varieties)

*Foraged/wild-managed:*
- Annonaceae fruits (dinosaur-fruit relatives - large, nutritious stonefruits)
- Conifer seeds and false-fruits
- Gnetophyte berries
- Leche (milky plant sap from tuberous roots)

*Animal protein (carne):*
- Fish from rivers - traps, spears
- Small game (grounders - small mammals, lizards, early skybirds)
- Ovos (eggs) - dinosaur, turtle, croc - carefully harvested, dangerous
- Insects (high protein, farmed in controlled areas - larvae, grubs, crawlers)
- Limited hunting of smaller dinosaurs outside safe zone (razortails - small theropods)

*Cultural food practices:*
- Communal cycad processing (labor-intensive, social event)
- Seasonal fruit harvests
- Ovo-gathering expeditions (dangerous but valuable)

**Daily life - Housing:**
Tree houses in village core. Provides protection from ground predators. Roofed structures (not open platforms) protect from aerial threats (flybeaks - large but primarily scavengers/fish-eaters, not major threat to adults but dangerous to yazhi).

**Technology philosophy:**
- **Hard tech (old-tech):** Metal, nuclear, synthetic materials, electronics. Dangerous because leaves geological traces. Kept only in safe zone (impact center), carefully inventoried, minimally used. Terms shortened through familiarity: gennie (generator), lightcell (battery/power storage).
- **Soft tech:** Bioengineering. Dangerous because can't be kept local (organisms move, reproduce). Exception: humans (can be kept in impact zone) and engineered organisms with mandatory dependencies/kill-switches.

**Key locations:**
- **The Vitarium (or "the kiva"):** Deep limestone cave system housing cell cultures. Natural constant temperature (20-24°C), high humidity, darkness. Contains human cell culture lines in stone/ceramic vessels, each producing one upgrade viral vector. Cultures glow different colors when healthy (bioluminescence). Require daily feeding of synthetic nutrient compound or undergo apoptosis within 24-48h (DNA self-destructs). Sacred/important space for the community.
- **Genesis Site (The Archive):** Original arrival point offshore 5-8km in 10-20m depth water on coral bank. Partially submerged, partially above water at low tide. Surrounded by dangerous currents, sharp formations, marine megafauna territory (mosasaurs, marine crocs). Structurally unstable, causes temporal disorientation. Contains: metal tablets with protocols, computer databases (possibly still powered), **time travel equipment (damaged/depleted but potentially functional - key to saving future)**, complete synthesis protocols, possibly more environmental suits, possibly preserved bodies, evidence that will challenge societal assumptions.

## Measurements
Express time in military (2130). Use the metric system for distances and weights.

## Language Evolution

**Origins:** White Sands, New Mexico area population base (Latino/Mexican, Native American - Navajo/Pueblo, diverse military/scientific from around world). Influences from Spanish, Navajo, Pueblo languages plus technical/military jargon.

**After 206 years:** Educated population (not illiterate), so language hasn't strayed far from English. Drift shows in:
- **Clipping/shortening** familiar terms (gennie, lightcell)
- **Compound formations** (mudwalk, razortail, sunfever)
- **Semantic extensions** (watcher, runner, biter)
- **Descriptive folk names** replacing Latin taxonomy (croc, razortail, flybeak, saropo)
- **Spanish loanwords** for common daily items (ovo, leche, carne, pan)
- **Native American terms** for cultural/spiritual concepts (yazhi, kiva)

**Common drift terms in regular use:**

*Animals:*
- **croc** - crocodilian (from crocodilian, scientific term shortened)
- **flybeak** - small pterosaur
- **saropo** - sauropod (from sauropod)
- **razortail** - small predatory theropod
- **grounder** - small burrowing mammal-like reptile
- **skybird** - bird or bird-like reptile
- **crawler** - small arthropod

*Technology:*
- **gennie** - generator
- **old-tech** - surviving modern device from original colonists
- **lightcell** - battery/power storage

*Environment/Survival:*
- **stingburn** - insect bite irritation
- **sunfever** - heatstroke
- **mudwalk** - long overland trek through difficult terrain
- **stonefruit** - Cretaceous edible fruit
- **fieldpack** - explorer's rucksack
- **watcher** - scout/lookout

*Spanish-influenced:*
- **ovo** (plural **ovos**) - egg (from huevo)
- **carne** - meat from hunted animals
- **pan** - baked cycad starch
- **leche** - milky plant sap

*Native American-influenced:*
- **yazhi** (Navajo: "small one") - young child, especially before True Name ceremony; term of endearment
- **kiva** (Pueblo: ceremonial chamber) - important ceremonial cave space, particularly the Vitarium or council chambers

## The Upgrade System
**Mechanism:** Viral vectors carrying genetic modifications, cultured from human cell lines in Vitarium. Delivered at specific developmental windows (prenatal, neonatal, infant, early childhood, late childhood). Each upgrade must be administered at correct stage or window closes. Not every person responds equally.

**THE UPGRADES ARE THE BIOLOGICAL SOLUTION** to the future pandemic. The viral vector technology can be adapted to cure/prevent the disease threatening future humanity.

**Response types:**
- Full expression (works as intended)
- Partial expression (some benefits, possible drawbacks)
- Null response (body rejects, no effect)
- Paradoxical response (unexpected side effects, sometimes beneficial)
- Delayed expression (manifests later, sometimes in adolescence/adulthood)

**Heritability:** Some upgrades compound across generations (inherited and enhanced); others non-heritable. Creates family lines with affinities for certain roles, but unpredictable.

**Social pressure:** No one forced to take treatments, but strong social expectation to give children every advantage. Choosing to skip upgrades seen as neglectful.

**The Seeding:** Ceremony where upgrade virus is administered (injection or other vector). Brief event, but followed by weeks/months of "the Taking" or "the Expression" (waiting to see if it works). Alternative ceremony names considered: the Grafting, the Imprinting, the Enkindling.

**Standard upgrades available** (all attempted on all children):

*Baseline/Universal (most people have at least moderate expression):*
- Immune enhancement (resistance to most diseases/infections)
- Digestive adaptation (metabolize Cretaceous flora, optimize metabolism for speed bursts vs endurance)
- Telepathic proximity sense (detect nearby minds - human and animal)

*Variable expression:*
- Enhanced vision (tetrachromatic, low-light, UV)
- Enhanced hearing (broader frequency)
- Enhanced smell (tracking, detection)
- Proprioception (spatial awareness, balance)
- Magnetic sense (directional orientation)
- Bone density/strength
- Muscle efficiency/strength  
- Endurance/metabolism optimization
- Thermal regulation
- Accelerated healing
- Venom/toxin resistance
- Mental projection (influence animal behavior - rare full expression)

**The Keepers (or Shepherds):** Elite role maintaining Vitarium cultures. Require perfect memory, attention to detail, steady hands. Possibly hereditary due to trust requirements. Knowledge of nutrient synthesis protocol closely guarded (prevent rogue humans from taking upgrade tissue elsewhere). Protocol required to be known by minimum 3 Master Keepers at any time.

**Naming traditions:** 
- Birth name (temporary/informal, until survival milestone)
- True name/Seeded name (given ~age 3-4 after critical early Seedings, survival odds improve) - marks transition from yazhi to named person
- Adult name (same as True name or additional element after completing all Seedings ~age 14-15)

**Infant mortality:** High before critical upgrades (especially immunity at 9 months). Disease from biting insects, predators, accidents. Creates emotional distance in parents, delayed full naming/welcoming. First Survival ceremony (age 2-3?) marks transition from yazhi to "person" status, possibly more important than individual Seedings.

## The Crisis - Knowledge Death
**The Catastrophe:** Catastrophic flood during storm season killed 2 of 3 Master Keepers simultaneously. Surviving Master Keeper (Teva's grandmother) developing Alzheimer's/dementia - some days sharp, some days confused. Can recite parts of synthesis protocol perfectly, then forget critical steps.

**Current situation (2-3 weeks before novel opens):**
- Journeyman Keepers know ~70-80% of synthesis process
- Their attempts produce compound that *almost* works
- Cultures surviving but weakening (colors dimming, growth slowing)
- Some fragile cultures already dead
- No Seedings can happen until crisis resolved
- Several children overdue for critical upgrades
- Infant mortality already increasing

**Critical implication:** If they lose the upgrade system, they lose the BIOLOGICAL SOLUTION to save future humanity. The mission itself is at stake, not just their own survival.

**Political response:** Leadership downplaying ("we'll solve it"), some factions want to access Archive, others fear journey/truths Archive might reveal.

**Why protagonists must act:** Adults won't act fast enough. Teva's grandmother's condition plus missing Master Keepers means knowledge actively degrading. Children (yazhi) dying without upgrades. Society losing ability to fulfill its mission. Only Archive has complete protocols, possibly functioning synthesis equipment, possibly more environmental suits, AND the time travel equipment/knowledge needed to actually save future Earth.

**Additional motivation:** Hope of finding more environmental suits at Genesis Site (currently only ~12 remain from original 200).

## Environmental Suits
**Origin:** Created before upgrade system functional. Allowed original settlers (too old for upgrades) to survive. Originally 200 suits; now ~12 remain (failed/destroyed over 206 years). Extremely precious old-tech relics, carefully inventoried.

**Capabilities:**
- **Structure:** 3-layer CNT/graphene weave (offset 60° each layer) with graphene film laminated between layers, impregnated with shear-thickening polymer. ~2mm thick base layer.
- **Living skin:** 1mm biofilm of engineered human chromatophore cells (cephalopod-style camouflage). Self-repairing (cells divide), responsive. Requires nutrients from substrate, produces bioluminescence when healthy.
- **Impact absorption:** 3-5mm aerogel foam/D3O-type layer underneath base structure.
- **Power:** Hybrid system - photovoltaic (perovskite/organic solar cells under chromatophore layer), thermoelectric (body heat differential), piezoelectric fibers (movement), biofuel cells (bacterial layer metabolic byproduct). ~10-15W generation, capacitor bursts to 100W for emergencies.
- **Thermal management:** Phase-change materials, thermoelectric cooling, distributed heat release, variable conductivity. Outer surface maintained at ambient +1-2°C. Heat stored temporarily, released gradually through extremities.
- **Sensors:** Chemical (predator pheromones), vibration (footfalls), electromagnetic (bioelectric fields), radar/lidar proximity.
- **Defenses:** Electric shock grid (capacitor-powered), chemical deterrent capsules, ultrasonic emitters, bioluminescent UV flash.
- **Protection:** Excellent slash resistance, very good puncture resistance (fangs/small predators), moderate blunt impact. Cannot stop large predator determined attack (crushing damage even if fabric holds). In water: camouflage helps when stationary, but movement still detectable by crocs/mosasaurs through vibration sensors.

**Total specs:** ~5-8mm thick (wetsuit-like), 2-3kg weight for full body suit.

**Custodianship:** Keo's parents are both Explorers (people with right upgrade combinations to survive outside safe zones to some extent). They are custodians/users of suits. This gives Keo training, exposure to survival knowledge, brief outside experience.

## Main Characters

### Keo (male protagonist, ~16-18)
**Physical:** Muscular, stocky (175cm/5'9", 80kg/175lbs). Strong, high endurance.

**Upgrades (strong expressions):**
- Enhanced vision, hearing, smell (full sensory suite)
- Excellent thermal regulation
- Accelerated healing (profound)
- Venom resistance (excellent)
- Metabolic optimization (baseline universal)
- Immune enhancement (baseline universal)
- Digestive adaptation (baseline universal)
- Telepathic proximity sense (STRONGEST of the three)
- Mental projection (EXCEPTIONAL - rare full expression, can control wild hadrosaur briefly with great effort, maintains control of Noli for extended periods)

**Background:** 
- Parents are Explorers (both), giving him training and survival knowledge
- Has been outside safe zone briefly on supervised trips
- Lost younger sibling to lack of upgrade (death motivates him)
- Not rebelling against parents' philosophy (they're ambivalent Traditionalist/Brancher) but against their protectiveness
- Loyal to Teva (primary motivation for journey)
- Refuses to steal suit for himself (hubris, self-sacrifice, proving himself capable without suit) - relies on upgrades + training

**Arc:** Loyal friend → vindicated Traditionalist → synthesizer of both philosophies. Learns nuance: adults aren't villains, just flawed people doing their best. People precious and worthy of love despite imperfection. Discovers that biological solution already exists (upgrades), but time travel mechanics must be solved. Eventually (across sequels) embraces radical hard tech to save both timelines, create viable future for his society beyond marginal existence (possibly offworld). Becomes both Traditionalist and heretic.

**Vulnerabilities without suit:** Visible to predators (no chromatophore camouflage). Must rely on mental projection, physical toughness, skill. This hubris nearly kills him at some point in the journey.

### Teva (female protagonist, ~16-18)
**Physical:** Average height, sturdy build (165cm/5'5").

**Upgrades:**
- Proprioception (EXCELLENT - spatial awareness, balance)
- Magnetic sense (EXCELLENT - compass-like directional orientation)
- Accelerated healing (profound)
- Venom resistance (excellent)
- Normal human sight, hearing, smell (sensory upgrades didn't take)
- POOR thermal regulation (overheats easily, bad reaction to heat loss from water - needs suit)
- Metabolic optimization (baseline universal)
- Immune enhancement (baseline universal)
- Digestive adaptation (baseline universal)
- Telepathic proximity sense (moderate)
- Mental projection (limited, like most humans - can gentle already-docile creatures)

**Background:**
- Grandmother is surviving Master Keeper (showing dementia)
- Sense of duty: must compensate for family role being impacted by grandmother's condition
- Planned for better upgrades due to grandmother's position; failures add to sense of family failure
- Possibly lost younger sibling (yazhi) to lack of upgrade (rage, grief, urgency)

**Role:** Navigator (proprioception, magnetic sense), resilient fighter. Emotionally driven, wants to blame someone. Journey teaches forgiveness/acceptance of tragedy.

**Why she needs suit:** Sensory compensation (suit's vibration detection, chemical sensors, EM sensing replace her poor natural senses). Critical: thermal management for survival - would die from sunfever/heat exposure without it.

### Benal "Ben" (secondary male character, ~16-18)
**Physical:** Unusually tall, thin, almost freakish (190cm/6'3", ~65kg/145lbs). Fragile, low endurance, tires easily. Likely failed/paradoxical upgrade expression (growth modification went wrong).

**Upgrades:**
- Smell and hearing (SUPERB)
- Normal human vision (enhancement didn't take)
- Excellent thermal regulation
- Accelerated healing (moderate, weaker than Keo/Teva)
- POOR venom resistance (critical gap)
- Metabolic optimization (baseline universal)
- Immune enhancement (baseline universal)
- Digestive adaptation (baseline universal)
- Telepathic proximity sense (moderate)
- Mental projection (limited, like most humans)

**Background:**
- Parents are Branchers (believe in branched timelines, no paradox possible)
- Physical fragility makes him valuable as scout/sensor but vulnerable in combat

**Role:** Scout, early warning system (superb smell/hearing detect threats from afar). Voice of caution vs Keo's impulsiveness. Intellectual conflict about ethics. Learns courage, physical resilience.

**Why he needs suit:** Cannot survive without it. Provides strength enhancement, endurance boost, puncture protection (critical for poor venom resistance).

### Noli (pet companion)
**Species:** Dromaeosaurus albertensis (or simply "Dromaeosaurus"). Female, 4-5 years old (middle-aged; lifespan 8-12 years). Slightly smaller than full adult male: ~14kg, less robust build. Coyote-sized (~2m long, 60cm tall at hip).

**Appearance:** Heavily feathered, bird-like. Prominent "wing" feathers on forearms, downy body covering, large intelligent eyes, distinctive sickle claws held off ground when walking.

**Behavior:** NOT genetically modified (prohibition on non-human bioengineering). Docility achieved through repeated telepathic influence by Keo. Bond demonstrates Keo's exceptional mental projection ability. Bonded strongly but could break free if Keo badly injured/unconscious.

**Role:** Companion providing color, occasional humor, useful (scouting, senses, minor defense), emotionally resonant. Dies at 50-65% mark of journey (mourned).

**Mental projection mechanics:** 
- Easier when closer (danger higher but effectiveness higher)
- Easier when nudging natural inclinations vs radically altering behavior
- Cannot simply dominate attacking predator
- Most useful: gentling calm animals, maintaining Noli control, subtle redirection (deflecting charge slightly to buy seconds)
- Risky but possible: calming curious but not yet aggressive predator
- Nearly impossible: stopping enraged predator mid-attack, radically changing trajectory (90° turn), controlling multiple animals simultaneously, long-range influence
- Distractions (injury, fear, exhaustion) break concentration
- Works on all animals but effectiveness varies by intelligence, brain structure, emotional state
- **Crocs and mosasaurs:** Mental projection barely effective against hungry crocodilians or marine predators - their predator drive overrides influence

## The Journey

**Distance:** 80km through Cretaceous Yucatan jungle to coast, then 5-8km offshore to Genesis Site coral bank.

**Terrain - Land:**
- Dense jungle (limited visibility)
- Rivers/swamps (crocs - MAJOR threat)
- Limestone caves (no cenotes - those formed after impact)
- Wetlands resembling mangrove-like habitat (dense coastal vegetation with ferns like Weichselia, palms like Nypa, salt-tolerant plants - NOT true mangroves which evolved 50mya later)
- Open savanna (exposed to large predators)

**Terrain - Wetlands:**
- Water everywhere, can't stay dry
- Visibility near zero in dense vegetation
- Footing treacherous (mud, roots, sinkholes)
- Crocs invisible, perfectly camouflaged
- No high ground to escape
- Must be avoided if possible, crossed quickly if necessary
- Elevated routes (fallen logs, root systems), poles to probe ahead
- Speed over stealth once committed

**Terrain - Offshore:**
- 5-8km open water to coral bank
- Dangerous currents, sharp coral formations
- Partially submerged Genesis Site structure
- Diving/swimming required to access interior

**Dangers - Land:**
- Theropod predators (various sizes, pack hunters, razortails)
- Herbivore herds (trampling)
- Venomous creatures
- Disease-carrying insects (stingburns)
- Heat/humidity/dehydration (sunfever risk, especially for Teva)
- Food scarcity (though metabolic adaptations help)
- Getting lost

**Dangers - Water (PRIMARY THREAT):**
- **Crocs (crocodilians):** Multiple species including giant Deinosuchus (7-10+ meters) in estuarine/coastal waters. Can detect vibrations as small as 4 micrometers through integumentary sensors. Attracted to splashing/thrashing. Patient, intelligent, fearless. Mental projection barely affects hungry crocs. NO effective chemical or sound deterrents exist. Only strategy: avoidance, physical barriers, constant vigilance, speed when crossing.
  
- **Marine predators offshore:**
  - **Mosasaurs** (MAJOR threat): Mosasaurus hoffmannii (up to 17m/56ft), Tylosaurus (13+m/42+ft). Apex predators, powerful swimmers, may lurk and pounce on passing prey. Detect vibration/movement. Attracted to disturbances.
  - **Marine crocs** (Dyrosauridae family): Live in both freshwater and marine environments
  - **Sharks:** Various Cretaceous species, less dangerous than mosasaurs but present
  - **Plesiosaurs:** Present but less of a threat

**Crossing water - Strategies:**
- **Distraction technique:** Large thrashing animal upstream draws crocs/predators, quick crossing downstream while attention diverted. NOT foolproof - crocs can detect multiple sources simultaneously, some may not take bait. Must combine with other factors.
- **Shallow/fast water preferred:** Crocs prefer deep, still water
- **Physical barriers help:** Stone weirs, underwater palisades where possible
- **Mental projection:** Limited effectiveness, but can sense presence and occasionally deflect approach
- **Speed essential:** Minimize time exposed
- **Suits help but don't guarantee survival:** Camouflage effective when stationary, movement still detectable; puncture resistance helps against smaller predators; crushing from large crocs/mosasaurs still lethal

**Timeline:** 7-10 days if lucky, realistically 2-3 weeks on foot (mudwalk) to coast. Water crossings are major set-pieces requiring careful planning. Offshore journey is its own major act (20-25% of novel). Then return journey with new knowledge and time pressure (cultures dying).

**The Theft:** Keo steals 2 environmental suits (one for Teva - thermal regulation critical, sensory compensation; one for Ben - strength/endurance/venom protection). Refuses to take one for himself (hubris, self-sacrifice, proving himself capable). Parents lose 2 of ~12 remaining suits - serious theft, high stakes, risks parents' reputation as custodians.

**What they carry:**
- Fieldpacks (minimal weight)
- Weapons (spears, knives - stone/metal that will be destroyed in impact)
- Water containers
- Some food (will run out, must forage for stonefruits, ovos, carne)
- Biodegradable navigation aids
- The two suits
- Noli accompanies them

**Motivations:**
- Teva: Duty (grandmother's failure, family role), possibly grief (lost yazhi sibling), knowledge that mission itself at stake
- Keo: Loyalty to Teva (primary), grief (lost sibling), rebellion against parental protectiveness, proving himself capable without suit
- Ben: [TBD - why does he join?]
- All: Society's survival (yazhi dying without upgrades), preserving mission (upgrades ARE the solution), hope of finding more suits, finding truth about timeline and time travel

**What they discover at Genesis Site:**
- Complete synthesis protocols (metal tablets, databases)
- **True timeline:** 2-3 decades until impact, not centuries
- **THE CRITICAL REVELATION:** Biological solution already exists (the upgrades themselves). They were supposed to TIME TRAVEL FORWARD with the solution, not bury/send it.
- **Time travel equipment:** Damaged/depleted but potentially functional. Instructions/data on forward time travel mechanics.
- Evidence of mission drift over 206 years
- Multiple asteroid trajectories, uncertainty about which will hit
- Possibly more suits, preserved bodies, personal logs, functioning AI
- [Other revelations TBD]
- **Sets up sequel:** Now they know the biological solution exists and time travel is the key. Must restore equipment, solve temporal mechanics, travel forward to save future Earth within 2-3 decades before impact.

## Stylistic Influences
- "Call it Courage" (Armstrong Sperry): survival, digging deep, confronting demons, growing up
- "Dune" (Frank Herbert): rich milieu, world-building as story element
- "The Hunger Games" (Suzanne Collins): coming-of-age, questioning authority, survival under pressure

## Thematic Elements
- Coming of age: independence from societal strictures, learning to think independently, questioning tradition
- Nuance: not all issues black/white, people worthy of love despite imperfection
- Survival: brutal, dangerous world requiring courage
- Identity: when humanity is engineered, what does it mean to be human?
- Mission vs. existence: serving future humanity vs. right to exist on own terms
- Technology: soft vs hard, what we're willing to become vs. what we refuse to use
- Biological solution to biological crisis: society's expertise makes them uniquely qualified, and they've succeeded - now must solve delivery mechanism (time travel)
- Lost knowledge: what happens when critical understanding degrades across generations
- Water as the ultimate danger: primal fear, constant vigilance required

## Unresolved Elements
[Moved answered questions out of this section; remaining questions below]

---

## Major Unresolved Questions

### Worldbuilding & Society
1. **Population genetics:** With only 900-1000 people and 206 years, how do they manage genetic diversity? Arranged pairings? Genetic counseling? Inbreeding concerns?

2. **Education system:** How is knowledge transmitted? Oral tradition plus biodegradable temporary records? Who teaches whom? What's considered essential knowledge vs. lost/deprecated?

3. **Religion/spirituality:** Has any developed? Reverence for the future they came from? Ancestor worship of original scientists? Nature-based beliefs? Secular rationalism maintained?

4. **Art and culture:** Music? Storytelling? Visual arts? What cultural practices have developed over 206 years? How do they mark major life events besides Seedings?

5. **Death and burial:** What happens to bodies? Can't leave bones in impact zone presumably. Biodegradable burial practices? Specific rituals?

6. **Explorer role details:** What exactly do Keo's parents do? How often do they leave safe zone? What's their mission (scouting, recruiting animals, gathering resources)? How dangerous is it really? What's their social status?

7. **Council specifics:** How many members? What age qualifies as "elder"? What decisions require unanimous vs. majority? How are disputes resolved?

8. **Relationship to dangerous fauna:** Besides deterrence, have they learned specific behavior patterns of major predators? Any species they've learned to coexist with?

### The Crisis & Journey
9. **Ben's motivation:** Why specifically does Ben decide to join this dangerous journey? Family pressure? Personal conviction? Friendship? Proving something despite physical limitations?

10. **How do they leave?** Sneak away at night? Make excuse? Tell anyone? What's their cover story? How quickly is absence discovered? Do parents suspect where they've gone?

11. **Specific fauna encounters:** Which Cretaceous species will they encounter and how? Need specific memorable/dramatic sequences. What kills Noli specifically? What near-death experiences does each character have?

12. **The offshore challenge:** How exactly do they reach Genesis Site? Find old boats/rafts stored from migration? Build raft? Swim? Who's best equipped? What goes wrong?

13. **Genesis Site interior:** Detailed layout. What rooms/areas? What's functional vs. destroyed? How do they navigate flooded sections? Temporal disorientation effects on each character? How do they access it (diving, swimming, wading)?

14. **The revelation sequence:** In what order do they discover truths? What creates maximum dramatic impact? Do they find bodies of original arrivals? Personal logs? Video recordings? AI still functioning?

15. **What can they bring back?** Synthesis protocols (how - memorization? Salvaged storage devices? Metal tablets small enough to carry?). Do they find working suits? Anything else portable and valuable? Weight limits?

16. **Return journey complications:** What's different/harder on way back? Injuries sustained? Weather changes? Pursued by predators? Knowledge weighing on them? Time pressure (cultures dying)? How long has elapsed?

17. **River crossing scenes:** Specific set-pieces. Which river crossings are most dangerous? When/how do they use distraction technique? Near-miss with croc? Does someone get grabbed? Noli's role?

### Character Development
18. **Romantic subplot?** Is there attraction between Keo and Teva? Love triangle with Ben? Or keep it platonic friendship? How does this develop during journey? Does it complicate dynamics?

19. **Major character moments:** What specific scenes define each character's arc? When does Keo's hubris (no suit) nearly kill him? When does Teva learn forgiveness? When does Ben show unexpected courage that saves them?

## Session Summary (v0.3 → v0.4)

**Decisions made:**
- **Language corrections:** Changed "gater" to "croc" throughout (scientific term shortened), "longneck" to "saropo" (from sauropod), "dustwalk" to "mudwalk" (better fits wet environment), removed "snapjaw" (redundant with crocs)
- **Expanded linguistic drift:** Added all optional terms (stonefruit, crawlers, fieldpack, grounders)
- **Spanish influences:** Added ovo/ovos (egg/eggs from huevo), carne (meat), pan (baked starch from cycads), leche (milky plant sap)
- **Native American influences:** Added yazhi (Navajo yazhi: small child/term of endearment, especially before True Name), kiva (Pueblo: ceremonial chamber - refers to Vitarium and important spaces)
- Integrated new terms naturally throughout document (ovos for eggs, yazhi for young children, kiva as alternate name for Vitarium, mudwalk for trek, croc consistently used)

**Key implications:**
- Linguistic texture now feels more authentic to White Sands, NM origins
- Spanish loanwords for common daily items feel natural (food, nature)
- Native American terms mark cultural/spiritual concepts
- "Croc" better reflects scientific background of colonists
- "Mudwalk" reinforces wet, tropical environment vs. desert imagery

**Document status:** Ready for next development phase. Major worldbuilding decisions made, but many craft/structure questions remain for actual novel writing.
