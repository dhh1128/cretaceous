Cretaceous - Draft Beat Sheet (v3)

This beat sheet outlines the major plot points for the novel based on the v0.4 milieu brief and subsequent plot revisions.

ACT 1: THE FAILING WORLD

1. COLD OPEN (The Catalyst):
We open in medias res in the Vitarium (kiva). The glowing cell cultures are dimming. Teva is at her grandmother's side, who is failing a public memory test of the synthesis protocol. A yazhi (a young child) is dying from a simple infection. The "Knowledge Death" is not a future threat; it is happening now. The adults are helpless. The yazhi dies. This is the crisis that breaks Teva's faith in the system.

2. NORMALCY & SET-UP (Flashback):
We jump back to "Two Days Earlier." This is the "normal world."

We see Keo and Noli, demonstrating their bond and his mental projection.

We see Benal (Ben), studying his "useless" temporal mathematics, isolated by his intellect.

We establish the "water is death" culture, the croc patrols, the political tension (Traditionalists vs. Branchers), and Keo's parents as the "Explorer" custodians of the few remaining environmental suits.

We hear the Theme Stated: An elder mentions the mission: "We hold the future in our hands, but the past is a cage."

3. THE DEBATE (Return to Present):
We are back in the immediate aftermath of the yazhi's death. The Council is paralyzed. Teva, enraged and grieving, declares she's going to the Genesis Site (The Archive) for the synthesis protocols. Keo, driven by loyalty, agrees. Ben insists on going—he is the only "Theorist" who can understand the temporal data that must also be at the Archive. This is his one chance.

4. BREAK INTO TWO (The Theft):
They know the journey is suicide without old-tech. Keo makes the fateful decision: he will steal two suits—one for Teva (critical for thermal regulation) and one for Ben (critical for protection/venom resistance). He will go without, trusting his upgrades and hubris. Under cover of night, the theft is successful. The three (four, with Noli) slip out of the Safe Zone perimeter. The 80km "mudwalk" begins.

ACT 2: THE MUDWALK

(Beats 5-10 are the former 7-12, renumbered)

5. B-Story:
The evolution of their friendship. It explores their conflicting philosophies (Brancher vs. Traditionalist) and forces them to rely on each other. Ben's abstract "Theorist" knowledge clashes with Keo's practical survivalism. This is also where the potential romantic subplot (Keo/Teva?) could develop, adding tension (Q#18).

6. Fun & Games (The "Promise of the Premise"):
This is the "survival" section of the novel.

They use their unique upgrades: Teva's navigation, Ben's super-senses (smell/hearing) as an early warning system, and Keo's sensory suite and mental projection.

Set-Piece 1: The First River Crossing. A major sequence where they must cross a croc-infested river. They use the "distraction technique" (Q#17), which only barely works, establishing the crocs as a terrifying, intelligent threat.

Keo's hubris (no suit) is tested, but he succeeds (for now).

Teva needs her suit's thermal management during a sunfever-inducing trek across an open savanna.

7. Midpoint (50% Mark):
Noli is killed. As specified in the brief (50-65% mark), this is a devastating blow. A pack of predators (razortails? or a lone, larger theropod?) ambushes them. Noli defends them, and Keo's mental projection falters under stress. Noli is killed. This is a "death" moment. The "adventure" is over; the reality of the danger is absolute. Keo's confidence is shattered.

8. Bad Guys Close In:
The journey gets harder.

Keo's hubris (no suit) finally catches up to him. He is badly injured in an encounter he would have survived with a suit (Q#19). Teva and Ben must use their own skills to save him.

Teva's suit is damaged, compromising her thermal regulation. She nearly dies.

They are stalked by a persistent predator.

They finally reach the coast, only to see the 5-8km of treacherous open water between them and the Genesis Site.

9. All Is Lost:
The offshore journey. They build a raft (Q#12) or find an old, cached one. A storm hits. They are attacked by a Mosasaur (Q#11). The raft is destroyed. They lose critical gear (perhaps their fieldpacks). They are separated and wash up on the sharp coral bank of the Genesis Site, battered, injured, and believing they've failed.

10. Dark Night of the Soul:
Keo, Teva, and Ben huddle in a flooded, unstable section of the Genesis Site. They are soaked, freezing (especially Teva), and defeated. Keo laments his hubris and Noli's death. Teva laments her grandmother and the yazhi they failed to save. Ben feels he has failed, as his "useless" knowledge was no help. The mission is over.

ACT 3: THE ARCHIVE & THE RETURN

11. Break into Three:
Ben's super-senses detect something: a hum, a smell. They find a functional, sealed hatch. Inside, they find a dry, powered section of the Archive. And there, etched on metal tablets: the complete synthesis protocols. They've done it. They have the solution to the immediate crisis. They are heroes. They could turn back now.

12. Finale (The Revelation):
They don't turn back. They explore further, drawn by the power and the hum.

Revelation (Part 1): They find the main logs. They see recordings of the Genesis Site arriving perfectly intact, with all original colonists celebrating. This directly contradicts their society's foundational myth of a "damaged arrival."

Revelation (Part 2): They realize their ancestors—the ones who founded their village—lied. But why? And where did the other colonists go?

Revelation (Part 3 - Benal's Epiphany): Benal finds the temporal mechanics lab. He sees the "impossible equation." But looking at the real data, he has his breakthrough: "It's not about going forward. It's about a return anchor. We... we can't go back. We were born here. Only the original colonists can."

The New Mission: The two revelations collide. The other colonists didn't just die—they left, taking the best tech. And they are the only ones who can complete the mission. The new quest is set: Find the "Lost Colonists."

13. THE RETURN (The Heretic's Ride):
They find a piece of functional old-tech: a solar/gennie-powered skiff (or light-terrain vehicle). This is their only way to get the protocols back before the kiva cultures die completely.

This is their first act of open heresy—choosing the mission's survival over Traditionalist taboos.

The journey back is a fast, high-octane "chase" sequence. The vehicle is loud and attracts predators. They are forced to outrun a T-Rex or evade crocs in an estuary at high speed.

This journey is the opposite of the trek out: not stealth, but speed; not Man vs. Nature, but Man vs. Monster.

14. THE CONFRONTATION:
They arrive back at the Safe Zone in their heretical old-tech vehicle, stunning everyone.

The Hero's Act: They hand over the synthesis protocols to the Journeyman Keepers, saving the kiva and the dying yazhi.

The Heretic's Act: They walk into the Council chamber. They don't just reveal the 2-3 decade timeline. They reveal the lie at the heart of their society: "Our founders lied. The Archive wasn't damaged. And the other colonists are still out there. They are the only ones who can save the future."

15. Final Image:
The stunned, furious, terrified faces of the Council. Keo, Teva, and Ben stand together, no longer children, having saved their people only to challenge their entire existence.

Potential Sequel Arcs (Book 2 & 3)

(This section remains unchanged as it already supports the new structure)

The Schism (Political Arc): The revelation splits their society. The Council/Traditionalists brand the trio heretics, suppress the truth, and may even hunt them. The Branchers are galvanized, seeing this as proof their philosophy was right. This brews a civil conflict over the society's future.

The Search (Action/Exploration Arc): The primary quest for Book 2 is to find the "Lost Colonists." This will force Keo, Teva, and Ben to travel outside the impact radius (a core taboo), following clues from the Archive into the unknown, dangerous world.

The "Lost Colony" (Mystery Arc): Who are the Lost Colonists after 206 years? Are they hostile? Have they built their own high-tech society? Are they the reason the ancestors lied (e.g., were they exiled? Or did they abandon the mission?)? They become the new, unknown antagonist or a complicated potential ally.

Benal's Solution (Intellectual Arc): Benal's "double jump" theory (meeting the originals at a second point in the past) becomes the technical goal. To achieve it, they must find the Lost Colonists and their advanced tech, and convince them to help.

The Ticking Clock (Threat Arc): The 2-3 decade impact window hangs over everything, accelerating all conflicts. The asteroid is the ultimate, non-negotiable deadline.
