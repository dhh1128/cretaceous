Cretaceous - Draft Beat Sheet (v10)

This beat sheet outlines the major plot points and includes the core rationale behind each structural decision.
v10 adds structural notes for "Archival Fragments" (epigraphs) and "Temporal Flashes" (backstory visions).

Structural Device: Archival Fragments (Modern Day News)

Purpose: To deliver the objective backstory of the pandemic and the original mission.

Placement: Used as epigraphs before each Act or major chapter block (e.g., ~4-5 times in the novel).

Content Example (for Act 1): News Headline: "GLOBAL PANDEMIC CONFIRMED: ORIGIN UNKNOWN." Body: A short, clipped paragraph about the virus's 99.9% mortality and the failure of all countermeasures.

Content Example (for Act 2): Internal Memo: "CHICXULUB SOLUTION AUTHORIZED. We go back to find an answer. We go back to save ourselves. Mission briefing 0800."

Content Example (for Act 3): Corrupted Log Entry: "...schism is complete. They're... jumping... [static]... We are the only ones left..."

Structural Device: Temporal Flashes (Visions)

Purpose: To deliver the subjective, emotional backstory of the "Noble Lie" and foreshadow the "Lost Colonists" (67mya).

Mechanism: A symptom of proximity to the damaged temporal equipment at the Genesis Site. They start weak (Beat 8) and become overwhelming at the site (Beat 10).

ACT 1: THE FAILING WORLD

1. COLD OPEN (The Catalyst):
[POV: Teva] [Fear Level: High (Masked by Grief & Rage)]
We open in medias res in the Vitarium (kiva). The glowing cell cultures are dimming. Teva is at her grandmother's side, who is failing a public memory test of the synthesis protocol. A yázhí (a young child) is dying from a simple infection. The adults are helpless (their fear is palpable paralysis). The yázhí dies. This is the crisis that breaks Teva's faith in the system.

Rationale (Pacing): Starting in medias res with the Catalyst provides an immediate emotional hook.

Rationale (Teva's Backstory): This scene is intensely personal for Teva. Her own parents died from a similar infection/plague years ago. The dying yázhí is a direct echo of her core trauma, which is why her reaction is rage, not just sadness.

2. UNSETTLED NORMALCY & SET-UP:
[Fear Level: Low (Simmering Anxiety)]
Instead of a flashback, the next day there is an attempt to return to normalcy, but the crisis hangs over everyone.

[POV: Keo] We see Keo trying tofind comfort in training Noli, but he's distracted and unsettled, masking his anxiety with a "we'll be fine" bravado.

[POV: Benal] We see Benal trying to focus on his "useless" temporal mathematics. His Brancher parent interrupts, dismissing his work: "Still staring at those dead symbols? Do something real." This establishes his family conflict: his parents pity his abstract work, seeing it as a symptom of his physical frailty.

[POV: Teva] We see Teva trying to drill other yázhí on croc protocols, but her heart isn't in it; she's filled with a cold, focused rage that has no outlet.

Rationale (Structure): Using "unsettled normalcy" maintains forward momentum. The "normal" scenes are now filled with dramatic irony.

3. THE DEBATE (Public & Private):
[POV: Keo] [Fear Level: Rising (Adrenaline & Resolve)]
The Council holds a tense, public debate, but they are paralyzed by indecision.

Clandestinely, Teva (driven by rage, masking her fear) finds Keo and Ben. She declares she's going to the Genesis Site (The Archive). It's a statement, not a request.

Keo (driven by loyalty and his crush, masking his fear with bravado) immediately agrees.

Benal (driven by intellectual pride) insists on going. He is visibly terrified, but his one chance at vindication is stronger than his fear. Keo notes this, impressed by Benal's "insane" courage.

Rationale (Agency): Splitting the debate into "public" (paralyzed adults) and "private" (decisive kids) establishes the central generational conflict.

Rationale (POV): Keo's POV lets us see Teva's "terrifying" resolve and Benal's overt fear, which Benal overcomes. This makes Keo the "center" of the trio's formation.

4. BREAK INTO TWO (The Theft):
[POV: Keo] [Fear Level: Extreme (Heist Tension / Adrenaline)]
They know the journey is suicide without old-tech. Keo makes the fateful decision: he will steal two suits. His fear is not of dinosaurs, but of getting caught and the shame of betraying his parents' trust. Under cover of night, the theft is successful. The three (four, with Noli) slip out of the Safe Zone perimeter. The 80km "mudwalk" begins.

Rationale (Parental Fallout & Stakes): The theft must have immediate, dire consequences. Keo's parents, as suit custodians, are implicated and confined. This is why no skilled rescue party follows. This action transforms the kids' journey, loading it with guilt.

ACT 2: THE MUDWALK

5. B-Story:
The evolution of their friendship. It explores their conflicting philosophies (Brancher vs. Traditionalist) and forces them to rely on each other.

Rationale (Emotional Core): The B-Story's tension is threefold: 1. Shared Guilt (betraying their families). 2. Unrequited Romance (Keo -> Teva -> Ben). 3. Skills Clash (Ben's abstract knowledge vs. Keo's practical survivalism).

Rationale (Maturation Arcs): Keo (Hubris to Humility), Teva (Rage to Nuance), Benal (Isolation to Vindication).

Rationale (Friendship): The journey moves them from a negative bond (guilt) to a positive one (compassion).

6. Fun & Games (The "Promise of the Premise"):
[Fear Level: Spiking during Set-Pieces]
This is the "survival" section of the novel.

[POV: Teva] Set-Piece 1: The First River Crossing. We are in Teva's head as she uses her navigation skills, fights her suit's thermal controls, and confronts the "water is death" mantra. She is terrified of crocs, but her anger at the Council (for forcing them out here) makes her push through it.

[POV: Benal] Set-Piece 2: The Constrictor. They are forced into dense, dark jungle. A giant constrictor snake (Madtsoiidae) ambushes them. This is a "boogeyman" threat—silent, dark, and grappling. It goes for Benal, the most fragile. His fear is paralyzing. He is saved by Keo's strength and Teva's quick thinking, deepening his reliance on them.

[POV: Keo] Keo's hubris (no suit) is tested, but he succeeds (for now). Teva needs her suit's thermal management during a sunfever-inducing trek across an open savanna.

7. Midpoint (50% Mark):
[POV: Keo] [Fear Level: Shock & Grief]
Noli is killed. A large azhdarchid pterosaur (e.g., Quetzalcoatlus) attacks from the sky, snatching Noli. It is a sudden, shocking, vertical attack that Keo's mental projection is powerless against. The "adventure" is over; the reality of the danger is absolute. Keo's confidence is shattered. His bravado breaks, and for the first time, he feels true fear.

Rationale (Friendship): This is a key bonding moment. Teva and Ben don't just "move on." They actively support Keo in his grief, showing compassion.

Rationale (The Predator): Using a large pterosaur creates a "boss-level" threat.

8. Bad Guys Close In:
[POV: Teva] [Fear Level: High (Persistent Dread)]
The journey gets harder. Keo is injured in an encounter he would have survived with a suit (Q#19). Teva (from her POV) has to step up, pushing down her own rising fear to be a caretaker.

Teva's suit is damaged, compromising her thermal regulation. She nearly dies.

The persistent predator that stalks them is the same pterosaur. Its shadow passing overhead forces them to hide and travel under cover, pushing them into more dangerous ground-level terrain. Teva is now terrified of the sky.

Temporal Flash (Foreshadow): As they get closer to the Genesis Site, the "temporal disorientation" begins. Keo, in his injured/feverish state, experiences the first temporal flash—a disorienting, meaningless symbol (the "signal" for the 67mya jump) and a feeling of departure. He dismisses it as fever.

Rationale (Friendship & Maturation): This beat is the crucible for their arcs. Keo is forced into vulnerability. Teva is forced to become a leader/caretaker.

Rationale (POV Irony): We are in Teva's head as she cares for Keo, seeing him as a brave, foolish friend. We know (from Beat 3) he's also nursing a painful crush on her, which adds a layer of dramatic irony to their interactions.

9. All Is Lost:
[POV: Benal] [Fear Level: Extreme (Overwhelming Panic)]
The offshore journey. They locate the old raft, but it's barely seaworthy. A storm hits. They are attacked by a Mosasaur (Q#11). We are in Benal's head—the most fragile, the most terrified of the physical world. This is his ultimate nightmare: drowning, chaos, and a sea monster. The raft is destroyed. They are separated and wash up on the sharp coral bank of the Gensis Site, battered and believing they've failed.

Rationale (Protagonist Competence): Having them plan to find the old raft makes them more competent.

10. Dark Night of the Soul:
[POV: Teva] [Fear Level: Despair (Cold & Hopeless)]
Keo, Teva, and Ben huddle in a flooded, unstable section of the Genesis Site. They are soaked, freezing (especially Teva), and defeated. The disorientation is now strong.

Temporal Flash (Emotional Core): As they huddle in despair, the flashes become overwhelming and specific, linked to their inner conflicts:

Teva's Flash: She sees a vivid vision of the original schism—the argument inside the Archive between the "Loyalist" founders and the "Heretic" founders. She sees the "Loyalists" (their ancestors) and is struck by their faces—not of malice, but of terror, grief, and stubborn paralysis.

Benal's Flash: He sees a disorienting, corrupted fragment of the "second jump" equation, mixed with a feeling of intellectual betrayal. He dismisses it as a nightmare.

Rationale (Emotional Stakes & Friendship): This is their moment of ultimate vulnerability, where they confide in each other.

Keo verbalizes his guilt: "I destroyed my family's lives for nothing."

Ben admits his shame: "My parents were right. My work is useless. They look at me and... they just pity me. I thought I'd find an answer, but I'm just a failure."

The Connection (Keo): Keo, hearing this, has his own small epiphany about his own parents: "Mine don't pity me... but they don't trust me. They see a kid to protect. You're trying to prove you're not fragile, and I'm trying to prove I'm not a child. We... we're fighting the same battle."

The Bridge (Teva): Teva, still reeling from her flash, provides the crucial compassion: "You're both... you're lucky. You have parents to fight with... I... I left my grandmother. She's all I have... and I left her while she's... disappearing."

Rationale (POV): Using Teva's POV makes her the emotional anchor. She listens to the boys' confessions and then provides the compassionate "bridge" speech, forging them into a "chosen family."

ACT 3: THE ARCHIVE & THE RETURN

11. Break into Three:
[POV: Benal] [Fear Level: Low (Replaced by Awe & Triumph)]
Ben's super-senses detect something: a hum, a smell. They find a functional, sealed hatch. Inside, they find a dry, powered section of the Archive. And there, etched on metal tablets: the complete synthesis protocols. They've done it. They have the solution to the immediate crisis.

12. Finale (The Revelation):
[POV: Benal] [Fear Level: Awe, then rising Intellectual Dread]
They don't turn back. Benal is drawn to the temporal lab.

Revelation (Part 1): They find the logs of the perfect arrival.

Revelation (Part 2 - Benal's Epiphany): Benal finds the "impossible equation." He's stuck. Keo or Teva makes a simple, frustrated comment: "It's like they just... left. Why couldn't they just go back?" This comment triggers Benal's epiphany. He connects the comment to the equation and his temporal flash from Beat 10. He realizes: "They couldn't go back. It's not about forward/backward. It's a return anchor. We... we can't go back. We were born here. Only the original colonists can."

Revelation (Part 3 - The Real Schism): He finds the data on the second jump (to 67mya), including the symbol Keo saw in his flash (Beat 8). He realizes this was the "signal" for the heretic jumpers. Their ancestors lied—or rather, created a "noble lie" to hold their shattered society together.

Rationale (POV Irony): We are in Benal's head, the only one who truly understands the terrifying scale of this discovery. Keo and Teva see the "lie," but we (and Benal) see the "impossible new mission."

Rationale (The "Lie"): The kids' initial, emotional reaction (especially from Teva's POV, which we'll see in Beat 14) is "They lied to us!" This is the emotional truth of the scene. Their maturation arc, particularly Teva's, will be to move from this black-and-white accusation to a more nuanced, gray understanding of why their ancestors created this "noble lie" (e.g., to prevent despair and maintain the Traditionalist mission).

13. THE RETURN (The Heretic's Ride):
[POV: Keo] [Fear Level: Extreme (Action / Adrenaline)]
They find a functional old-tech skiff. This is their only way to get back in time.

This is their first act of open heresy.

The journey back is a fast, high-octane "chase" sequence. The vehicle is loud and attracts predators.

Action Climax: The Quetzalcoatlus from Beat 7 spots them and gives chase. This is Keo's redemption. He's not just running; he's piloting. He's no longer the grieving, shattered boy; he's a focused leader using tech to fight the monster that mental projection couldn't. He successfully evades/defeats it (e.g., by luring it into a Mosasaur attack or a canyon wall).

Rationale (Pacing & Theme): The skiff solves the "return journey" pacing problem and serves as a critical thematic beat (embracing heretical hard-tech).

Rationale (Character Arc): This is Keo's action climax, where he faces the same threat that broke him (Beat 7) and wins, completing his "Hubris to Humility to Competence" arc.

14. THE CONFRONTATION:
[POV: Kea] [Fear Level: High (Social Confrontation)]
They arrive back at the Safe Zone in their heretical old-tech vehicle, stunning everyone.

The Hero's Act: They hand over the synthesis protocols, saving the kiva.

The Heretic's Act: They walk into the Council chamber. Their parents are prisoners. They reveal the lie at the heart of their society.

Rationale (Emotional Climax): Vindication.

Rationale (Maturation Climax): This is the emotional payoff. From Keo's POV, he understands his parents (seeing their fear and pride) rather than just feeling guilty.

Rationale (Teva's Nuance Arc): As Teva makes the accusation (which we see through Keo's POV), she will see the Council's faces. She won't see villains who were "caught." She will see the same terrified, paralyzed faces from Beat 1. This is the moment of her epiphany. She has a flash of the ancestors' faces she saw in her vision (Beat 10) and realizes they are identical. This is the seed of her nuance arc: she's the first to realize, "They... they're not liars. They're... believers. They're just wrong." This fulfills her maturation from "Rage to Nuance," as she sees the flawed, frightened humanity behind the "noble lie."

Rationale (Benal's Vindication Arc): Ben stands with his friends, his "useless" work now vindicated as the most important knowledge in their world.

15. Final Image:
[POV: Keo] [Fear Level: Low (Replaced by Determination)]
The stunned, furious, terrified faces of the Council. Keo's parents, standing under guard, lock eyes with their son with a look of terrifying, vindicated pride. Benal's parents look at their fragile son with new, shocked respect. Keo, Teva, and Ben stand together, no longer children, having saved their people only to challenge their entire existence.

Potential Sequel Arcs (Book 2 & 3)

(Rationale: These arcs are the logical, direct consequence of the revelations in Beat 12 & 14).

The Schism (Political Arc): The revelation splits their society. The Council/Traditionalists brand the trio heretics and suppress the truth. The Branchers are galvanized. This brews a civil conflict over control of the Archive and the hard-tech skiff.

The Search (Intellectual/Action Arc): The primary quest for Book 2 is to re-establish the "signal" and solve the "second jump" equation. This will require them to protect and use the Archive, putting them in direct conflict with the Council. The "flashes" (temporal disorientation) become a key plot device for Benal to decipher.

The "Lost Colony" (Mystery Arc): Who are the Lost Colonists in 67mya? What did they build? Did they succeed? Are they trying to communicate back? Benal's "signal" may be a way to talk to them, but the "flashes" are the key to understanding what happened.

Benal's Solution (Intellectual Arc): Benal's "double jump" theory is confirmed. Now he must execute it. He must figure out how to send the "signal" that the first group received, and then make the jump himself. This becomes the trilogy's technical endgame.

The Ticking Clock (Threat Arc): The 2-3 decade impact window hangs over everything, accelerating all conflicts. The asteroid is the ultimate, non-negotiable deadline.
