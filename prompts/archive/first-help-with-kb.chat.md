I'll help you build a comprehensive foundation for "Cretaceous." Here are my concise answers:

## 1. Background Research Needed

**Paleontology/Geography:**
- Late Cretaceous Yucatan flora: ferns, cycads, palms, conifers
- Fauna: Theropods (tyrannosaurs, dromaeosaurs), hadrosaurs, ceratopsians, pterosaurs, crocodilians
- Climate: tropical, humid, seasonal monsoons, sea levels higher
- Terrain: coastal lowlands, limestone karst, swamps, rivers
- Day length (23.5 hours), oxygen levels (30% higher), gravity effects

**Scientific/Technical:**
- Temporal mechanics terminology: causality loops, timeline branching, temporal coordinates, chronon particles
- Asteroid impact mechanics: blast radius, ejecta patterns, seismic effects, nuclear winter timeline
- Chicxulub crater: 180km diameter, impact zone geography

**Cultural/Survival:**
- Survival skills: water purification, shelter building, fire starting, tracking
- Post-scarcity society dynamics and breakdown
- Generational memory loss, oral tradition corruption
- Teen psychology: identity formation, rebellion, risk-taking

## 2. Worldbuilding Artifacts Needed

**Physical World:**
- Territory map: settlement location, forbidden zones, travel routes, resource sites, danger areas
- Flora/fauna field guide: edible plants, dangerous species, domesticable creatures
- Technology inventory: salvaged equipment, degraded tools, improvised gear
- Settlement layout: buildings, defenses, resource storage

**Society/Culture:**
- Social structure: governance, family units, education system, work assignments
- Laws/taboos: travel restrictions, breeding protocols, resource allocation, punishment systems
- Rituals: coming-of-age ceremonies, remembrance days, safety protocols
- Teen slang: temporal terms ("chrono'd," "paradoxed"), dinosaur nicknames, rebellion phrases
- Naming conventions: scientific vs. colloquial for species
- Clothing/appearance: practical vs. traditional elements

**Knowledge Systems:**
- What's remembered vs. lost from original mission
- Myths that developed around the founding
- Education curriculum: survival skills, temporal theory (incomplete), history

## 3. Outline Development Help

**Structure approach:**
- Three-act structure with 25-30 chapters
- Act I: Setup and departure (20-25k words)
- Act II: Journey and trials (35-45k words)
- Act III: Discovery and transformation (15-25k words)

**Key plot points to map:**
- Inciting incident triggering departure
- First threshold: leaving Enclave
- Midpoint revelation changing objectives
- Dark night crisis testing resolve
- Climax discovery at original site
- Resolution with sequel setup

**Scene-by-scene breakdown:**
- Each chapter's POV, location, conflict, emotional arc
- Character development beats distributed throughout
- Worldbuilding reveals paced for intrigue

## 4. Character Dossier Components

**For each character:**
- Name, age, role in society
- Physical description (3-5 distinctive traits)
- Personality: dominant traits, fears, desires, flaws
- Background: family, education, position
- Skills/abilities: practical and psychic
- Speech patterns/mannerisms
- Internal conflict/wound
- External goal and obstacles
- Character arc: beginning state → transformation → end state
- Relationships: with protagonist, other characters, society
- Key scenes where they shine
- Secrets they harbor

## 5. Questions to Answer Now

**Plot/Structure:**
- What specific event triggers the protagonist's departure?
    

- What false belief does he hold at story start that he'll overcome?

    That he is rebellious and angry at his parents. (He does chafe under some restrictions, but he actually admires his parents and knows they have a lot of good judgment.)
    That he is weak

- What's the ticking clock besides the eventual asteroid?
- How many major setbacks before success?
- What's the specific discovery that changes everything?
- What does each friend bring to/learn from the journey?
- What sequel hooks to plant?

**Protagonist specifics:**
- Age?
    17

- Name and meaning?
    Keo - Shortened from Keone, Hawaiian. Keo's ancestor was a colonel stationed near White Sands, New Mexico at the time the backstory took place, and came to provide security and peacekeeping in the settlement of designated survivors.

- What tradition does he first question?
    

- Specific trauma/wound from his upbringing?
- What does he want vs. what he needs?
- Psychic ability strength/weakness?

**World mechanics:**
- How strong are psychic powers? Limitations?
- How much tech survived? What degraded?
- Population size and sustainability?
- How many generations passed (you mentioned ~200 years)?
- What precipitates the breaking of taboos NOW?

**Voice/Style:**
- First or third person?
- Past or present tense?
- How much internal monologue?
- Balance of action/dialogue/description?
- How to handle dino-danger without repetition?

**Themes:**
- Primary: independence vs. community responsibility?
- Secondary: truth vs. comfortable lies?
- How to avoid heavy-handedness?

## 6. GitHub/RAG Strategy Advice

**File organization:**
```
/worldbuilding
  - geography-map.md
  - flora-fauna-guide.md
  - technology-inventory.md
  - social-structure.md
  - slang-terminology.md
/characters
  - protagonist.md
  - friend1-male.md
  - friend2-female.md
  - authority-figure.md
  - etc.
/plot
  - outline-three-act.md
  - scene-breakdown.md
  - timeline.md
/research
  - cretaceous-facts.md
  - temporal-mechanics.md
/drafts
  - chapter-01.md (etc.)
```

**Best practices:**
- Use consistent headers (##) for easy parsing
- Tag sections for quick reference (#character-arc, #physical-description)
- Keep master index.md with file descriptions
- Version major changes
- Include "Last updated" dates
- Use yaml frontmatter for metadata
- Cross-reference between files (link to other docs)
- Separate "canon" from "maybe/brainstorm" notes
- Include word counts for draft chapters

## Suggested Order of Work

1. **Answer critical questions** (question 5) - foundations first
2. **Core research** (question 1) - enough to proceed, not exhaustive
3. **Protagonist dossier** (question 4) - he's the lens
4. **Supporting character dossiers** (question 4) - especially the two friends
5. **World mechanics/society rules** (question 2) - how this world works
6. **Territory map** (question 2) - geography shapes plot
7. **Three-act outline** (question 3) - major beats and turning points
8. **Detailed scene breakdown** (question 3) - chapter-by-chapter
9. **Remaining worldbuilding** (question 2) - slang, customs, etc.
10. **Begin drafting** - with periodic returns to refine artifacts

This approach builds from character (heart) through world (stage) to plot (action), ensuring emotional authenticity guides everything.
