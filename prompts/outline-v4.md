Cretaceous - Draft Beat Sheet (v4)

This beat sheet outlines the major plot points for the novel based on the v0.4 milieu brief and subsequent plot revisions.

ACT 1: THE FAILING WORLD

1. COLD OPEN (The Catalyst):
We open in medias res in the Vitarium (kiva). The glowing cell cultures are dimming. Teva is at her grandmother's side, who is failing a public memory test of the synthesis protocol. A yázhí (a young child) is dying from a simple infection. The "Knowledge Death" is not a future threat; it is happening now. The adults are helpless. The yázhí dies. This is the crisis that breaks Teva's faith in the system.

2. UNSETTLED NORMALCY & SET-UP:
Instead of a flashback, the next day there is an attempt to return to normalcy, but the crisis hangs over everyone.

We see Keo trying to find comfort in training Noli, but he's distracted and unsettled by the yázhí's death.

We see Benal (Ben) trying to focus on his "useless" temporal mathematics, but the Council's real-world failure makes his abstract work feel pointless.

We see Teva trying to drill other yázhí on croc protocols, but her heart isn't in it; she's filled with a cold rage.

This "unsettled" sequence establishes the "water is death" culture, the political tension (Traditionalists vs. Branchers), Keo's parents as the "Explorer" custodians of the environmental suits, and the Theme Stated: An elder mentions the mission: "We hold the future in our hands, but the past is a cage."

3. THE DEBATE (Public & Private):
The Council holds a tense, public debate about the failing kiva, but they are paralyzed by indecision.

Clandestinely, Teva, enraged and grieving, finds Keo and Ben. She declares she's going to the Genesis Site (The Archive) for the synthesis protocols. This is not a debate for her; it's a statement.

Keo, driven by loyalty, immediately agrees.

Ben insists on going—he is the only "Theorist" who can understand the temporal data that must also be at the Archive. This is his one chance to find a real answer.

4. BREAK INTO TWO (The Theft):
They know the journey is suicide without old-tech. Keo makes the fateful decision: he will steal two suits—one for Teva (critical for thermal regulation) and one for Ben (critical for protection/venom resistance). He will go without, trusting his upgrades and hubris. Under cover of night, the theft is successful. The three (four, with Noli) slip out of the Safe Zone perimeter. The 80km "mudwalk" begins.

ACT 2: THE MUDWALK

(Beats 5-10 are the former 7-12, renumbered)

5. B-Story:
The evolution of their friendship. It explores their conflicting philosophies (Brancher vs. Traditionalist) and forces them to rely on each other. Ben's abstract "Theorist" knowledge clashes with Keo's practical survivalism. This is also where the potential romantic subplot (Keo/Teva?) could develop, adding tension (Q#18).

6. Fun & Games (The "Promise of the Premise"):
This is the "survival" section of the novel.

They use their unique upgrades: Teva's navigation, Ben's super-senses (smell/hearing) as an early warning system, and Keo's sensory suite and mental projection.

Set-Piece 1: The First River Crossing. A major sequence where they must cross a croc-infested river. They use the "distraction technique" (Q#17), which only barely works, establishing the crocs as a terrifying, intelligent threat.

Keo's hubris (no suit) is tested, but he succeeds (for now).

Teva needs her suit's thermal management during a sunfever-inducing trek across an open savanna.

7. Midpoint (50% Mark):
Noli is killed. As specified in the brief (50-65% mark), this is a devastating blow. A pack of predators (razortails? or a lone, larger theropod?) ambushes them. Noli defends them, and Keo's mental projection falters under stress. Noli is killed. This is a "death" moment. The "adventure" is over; the reality of the danger is absolute. Keo's confidence is shattered.

8. Bad Guys Close In:
The journey gets harder.

Keo's hubris (no suit) finally catches up to him. He is badly injured in an encounter he would have survived with a suit (Q#19). Teva and Ben must use their own skills to save him.

Teva's suit is damaged, compromising her thermal regulation. She nearly dies.

They are stalked by a persistent predator.

They finally reach the coast, only to see the 5-8km of treacherous open water between them and the Genesis Site.

9. All Is Lost:
The offshore journey. As part of their plan, they locate the old raft cached on the coast, just as oral history described. It's barely seaworthy. A storm hits. They are attacked by a Mosasaur (Q#11). The raft is destroyed. They lose critical gear (perhaps their fieldpacks). They are separated and wash up on the sharp coral bank of the Genesis Site, battered, injured, and believing they've failed.

10. Dark Night of the Soul:
Keo, Teva, and Ben huddle in a flooded, unstable section of the Genesis Site. They are soaked, freezing (especially Teva), and defeated. Keo laments his hubris and Noli's death. Teva laments her grandmother and the yázhí they failed to save. Ben feels he has failed, as his "useless" knowledge was no help. The mission is over.

ACT 3: THE ARCHIVE & THE RETURN

11. Break into Three:
Ben's super-senses detect something: a hum, a smell. They find a functional, sealed hatch. Inside, they find a dry, powered section of the Archive. And there, etched on metal tablets: the complete synthesis protocols. They've done it. They have the solution to the immediate crisis. They are heroes. They could turn back now.

12. Finale (The Revelation):
They don't turn back. They explore further, drawn by the power and the hum.

Revelation (Part 1): They find the main logs. They see recordings of the Genesis Site arriving perfectly intact, with all original colonists celebrating. This directly contradicts their society's foundational myth of a "damaged arrival."

Revelation (Part 2 - Benal's Epiphany): Benal finds the temporal mechanics lab. He sees the "impossible equation." But looking at the real data, he has his breakthrough: "It's not about going forward. It's about a return anchor. We... we can't go back. We were born here. Only the original colonists can."

Revelation (Part 3 - The Real Schism): Benal finds fragmented data and log entries about a second temporal jump, made by a large portion of the original colonists, back to 67mya. This is where they went. Our ancestors are the ones who refused to go, calling it "off-mission" or "heresy," and then lied, claiming the others were "lost in transit" to hide their own crisis of faith and the schism.

The New Mission: The quest is set: Re-establish the "signal" (which may be what the "flashes" are) with the "Lost Colonists" (who are in a different time, not place) and figure out how to make the same "second jump" to join them.

13. THE RETURN (The Heretic's Ride):
They find a piece of functional old-tech: a solar/gennie-powered skiff (or light-terrain vehicle). This is their only way to get the protocols back before the kiva cultures die completely.

This is their first act of open heresy—choosing the mission's survival over Traditionalist taboos.

The journey back is a fast, high-octane "chase" sequence. The vehicle is loud and attracts predators. They are forced to outrun a T-Rex or evade crocs in an estuary at high speed.

This journey is the opposite of the trek out: not stealth, but speed; not Man vs. Nature, but Man vs. Monster.

14. THE CONFRONTATION:
They arrive back at the Safe Zone in their heretical old-tech vehicle, stunning everyone.

The Hero's Act: They hand over the synthesis protocols to the Journydman Keepers, saving the kiva and the dying yázhí.

The Heretic's Act: They walk into the Council chamber. They don't just reveal the 2-3 decade timeline. They reveal the lie at the heart of their society: "Our founders lied. The Archive wasn't damaged. The other colonists left... they jumped back in time. They are the ones we must find."

15. Final Image:
The stunned, furious, terrified faces of the Council. Keo, Teva, and Ben stand together, no longer children, having saved their people only to challenge their entire existence.

Potential Sequel Arcs (Book 2 & 3)

The Schism (Political Arc): The revelation splits their society. The Council/Traditionalists brand the trio heretics and suppress the truth. The Branchers are galvanized. This brews a civil conflict over control of the Archive and the hard-tech skiff.

The Search (Intellectual/Action Arc): The primary quest for Book 2 is to re-establish the "signal" and solve the "second jump" equation. This will require them to protect and use the Archive, putting them in direct conflict with the Council. The "flashes" (temporal disorientation) become a key plot device for Benal to decipher.

The "Lost Colony" (Mystery Arc): Who are the Lost Colonists in 67mya? What did they build? Did they succeed? Are they trying to communicate back? Benal's "signal" may be a way to talk to them, but the "flashes" are the key to understanding what happened.

Benal's Solution (Intellectual Arc): Benal's "double jump" theory is confirmed. Now he must execute it. He must figure out how to send the "signal" that the first group received, and then make the jump himself. This becomes the trilogy's technical endgame.

The Ticking Clock (Threat Arc): The 2-3 decade impact window hangs over everything, accelerating all conflicts. The asteroid is the ultimate, non-negotiable deadline.
