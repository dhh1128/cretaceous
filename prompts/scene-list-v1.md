This document breaks down the 15-beat outline (v10) into a granular, 40-scene list. Each scene is a distinct unit of action with a specific POV.

Format: [Scene #] [POV Character] [Location] [Fear Level (and/or Key Emotion)]

ACT 1: THE FAILING WORLD (Beats 1-4)

BEAT 1: COLD OPEN (The Catalyst)

1.1 [TEVA] [Vitarium (Kiva)] [HIGH (Grief & Rage)] - Teva watches the dimming cultures as her grandmother fails the protocol. The yázhí dies. Teva's internal rage solidifies.

BEAT 2: UNSETTLED NORMALCY & SET-UP

2.1 [KEO] [Safe Zone Perimeter] [LOW (Anxiety)] - Keo trains Noli. His bravado (masking anxiety) is evident.

2.2 [BENAL] [Family Dwelling] [LOW (Frustration)] - Benal studies his math. His parent's dismissal ("do something real"). His shame/isolation.

2.3 [TEVA] [Village Center] [LOW (Cold Rage)] - Teva drills yázhí on croc protocols. Her internal monologue contrasts the "useless" drill with the real threat (the plague).

BEAT 3: THE DEBATE (Public & Private)

3.1 [KEO] [Council Chamber] [RISING (Frustration)] - Keo attends the public Council meeting. He witnesses the adults' paralysis and fear.

3.2 [KEO] [Clandestine Location (e.g., Kiva entrance)] [RISING (Adrenaline)] - Teva confronts him. "I'm going." Her conviction is terrifying.

3.3 [KEO] [Clandestine Location] [RISING (Resolve)] - Benal arrives, insisting he go. Keo sees Benal's visible terror and is awed by his courage. Keo agrees (loyalty, crush, and now, respect).

BEAT 4: BREAK INTO TWO (The Theft)

4.1 [KEO] [His Dwelling (Night)] [HIGH (Guilt)] - Keo looks at his sleeping parents. The weight of his betrayal (the guilt) is the scene's focus.

4.2 [KEO] [Suit Repository] [EXTREME (Heist Tension)] - The physical act of the theft. Nearly getting caught.

4.3 [KEO] [Perimeter] [EXTREME (Resolve)] - Meeting Teva/Benal. Slipping past the watchers. The final, irreversible step into the jungle.

ACT 2: THE MUDWALK (Beats 5-10)

(BEAT 5: B-Story - Woven into all scenes)

BEAT 6: FUN & GAMES (The "Promise of the Premise")

6.1 [TEVA] [Riverbank] [SPIKING (Dread)] - The trio argues about how to cross the first river. Teva's navigation skills and suit give her the authority.

6.2 [TEVA] [First River] [SPIKING (Panic)] - The crossing. A croc brushes her suit. She fights her suit's thermals and her own terror.

6.3 [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [RISING (Dread)] - The environment closes in. His super-senses are overwhelmed. Claustrophobia.

6.4 [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [PARALYZING (Panic)] - The Madtsoiidae (constrictor) attack. Pure, silent terror. Keo/Teva save him.

6.5 [KEO] [Open Savanna] [LOW (Hubris)] - The sunfever trek. Keo (no suit) feels fine, pushing the pace. His bravado is high.

6.6 [TEVA] [Open Savanna] [HIGH (Weakness)] - Same trek, her POV. Her suit is struggling with thermal load. She is dizzy, near collapse, but hides it.

BEAT 7: MIDPOINT (Noli's Death)

7.1 [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [LOW (Content)] - A rare moment of peace. Keo is playing with Noli, sharing food.

7.2 [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [SHOCK] - The Quetzalcoatlus attack. It's over in seconds. The sky is empty.

7.3 [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [GRIEF (Numb)] - The silence. Teva moves his pack for him. Benal just sits nearby. Their quiet, physical presence is the first act of true compassion.

BEAT 8: BAD GUYS CLOSE IN

8.1 [TEVA] [Jungle Undergrowth] [HIGH (Dread)] - The shadow of the Quetzalcoatlus passes overhead. They hide. Teva is now terrified of the sky.

8.2 [KEO] [Gulch/Ravine] [HIGH (Reckless Rage)] - Keo's injury. He takes a stupid risk trying to climb (e.g., against a pack of Razortails), driven by grief over Noli.

8.3 [TEVA] [Camp (Night)] [HIGH (Exhaustion)] - Tending Keo's wound. Her suit is failing. The "POV Irony" scene (caring for him, while we know he has a crush).

8.4 [KEO] [Camp (Night/Fever)] [DISORIENTATION] - Keo's Temporal Flash (the symbol). He's feverish, dismisses it.

BEAT 9: ALL IS LOST (The Offshore Journey)

9.1 [BENAL] [The Coast] [HIGH (Dread)] - They find the raft. It's a wreck. Benal's absolute terror of the open water.

9.2 [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Panic)] - The storm hits. The raft is tossing.

9.3 [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Terror)] - The Mosasaur attacks. The raft shatters. Benal is plunged into the dark water.

9.4 [BENAL] [Coral Bank (Genesis Site)] [DESPAIR] - Washing up. Battered. Finding Keo, then Teva. They've "failed."

BEAT 10: DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

10.1 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Cold)] - Huddling, freezing. The disorientation is strong. Teva's Flash (the schism).

10.2 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Numb)] - The silence after the flash. Keo speaks: "I destroyed my family..."

10.3 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Connecting)] - Benal confesses his shame. Keo makes the connection.

10.4 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [COMPASSION] - Teva's "bridge" speech ("You're lucky..."). The "chosen family" is forged.

ACT 3: THE ARCHIVE & THE RETURN (Beats 11-15)

BEAT 11: BREAK INTO THREE (The First Win)

11.1 [BENAL] [Archive (Exploring)] [RISING (Curiosity)] - Benal follows his senses (the hum, the scent). Finding the sealed hatch.

11.2 [BENAL] [Archive (Sealed Lab)] [AWE/TRIUMPH] - The lab is dry, powered. The metal tablets. "I found it. I found the protocols."

BEAT 12: FINALE (The Revelation)

12.1 [BENAL] [Archive (Temporal Lab)] [AWE] - Finding the mission logs (the perfect arrival). The "lie" is revealed.

12.2 [BENAL] [Archive (Temporal Lab)] [DREAD (Frustration)] - The "impossible equation." He's stuck.

12.3 [BENAL] [Archive (Temporal Lab)] [EPIPHANY] - Keo/Teva's "chance comment." It connects everything: the equation, his flash (Beat 10), Keo's flash (Beat 8.4). The "Noble Lie" and the real mission become clear.

BEAT 13: THE RETURN (The Heretic's Ride)

13.1 [KEO] [Archive (Hangar)] [RISING (Heresy)] - Finding the skiff. The debate is nonexistent. This is the only way.

13.2 [KEO] [Skiff (Mangroves)] [HIGH (Action)] - The Quetzalcoatlus (Noli's killer) attacks. The chase begins.

13.3 [KEO] [Skiff (Canyon/River)] [EXTREME (Action)] - Keo's redemption. He's not just a "brute"; he's a pilot. He uses the tech to execute a brilliant maneuver, defeating the pterosaur.

BEAT 14: THE CONFRONTATION

14.1 [KEO] [Safe Zone (Landing Area)] [HIGH (Social Confrontation)] - The skiff lands. The stunned silence. The walk through the crowd. He sees his parents, under guard.

14.2 [TEVA] [Council Chamber] [HIGH (Vindication)] - Her POV. She slams the protocols on the table. The accusation. "You were wrong."

14.3 [TEVA] [Council Chamber] [EPIPHANY] - Her POV. She sees the Council's faces. They match her flash (Beat 10). Her "Rage to Nuance" arc clicks. They aren't liars; they're frightened believers.

14.4 [BENAL] [Council Chamber] [HIGH (Vindication)] - His POV. He steps forward to explain the temporal truth. He sees his parents' faces change from pity to awe. His arc is complete.

BEAT 15: FINAL IMAGE

15.1 [KEO] [Council Chamber] [LOW (Determination)] - Back to Keo. He surveys the new power dynamic. His parents' pride. The Council's terror. He stands with his family. The end.
