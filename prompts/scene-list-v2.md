# Scene List
This document breaks down the 15-beat outline (v10) into a granular, 40-scene list. Each scene is a distinct unit of action with a specific POV.

Format: [Scene #] [POV Character] [Location] [Fear Level (and/or Key Emotion)] [Milieu Note]

ACT 1: THE FAILING WORLD (Beats 1-4)

BEAT 1: COLD OPEN (The Catalyst)

1.1 [TEVA] [Vitarium (Kiva)] [HIGH (Grief & Rage)] - Teva watches the dimming cultures as her grandmother fails the protocol. The yazhi dies. Teva's internal rage solidifies.

BEAT 2: UNSETTLED NORMALCY & SET-UP

2.1 [KEO] [Enclave Perimeter] [LOW (Anxiety)] - Keo trains Noli. His bravado (masking anxiety) is evident.

2.2 [BENAL] [Family Dwelling] [LOW (Frustration)] - Benal studies his math. His parent's dismissal ("do something real"). His shame/isolation.

2.3 [TEVA] [Village Center (Yazhi Pool)] [LOW (Cold Rage)] - Teva drills yazhi on croc protocols. Her internal monologue contrasts the "useless" drill with the real threat (the plague). [Milieu: A sudden, driving, warm rainstorm. The rain comes down in sheets, and the yazhi (Joss, Miri) huddle under a leaking fern-thatch roof. Teva welcomes the respite from her overheating.]

BEAT 3: THE DEBATE (Public & Private)

3.1 [KEO] [Council Chamber] [RISING (Frustration)] - Keo attends the public Council meeting. He witnesses the adults' paralysis and fear.

3.2 [KEO] [Clandestine Location (Kiva entrance)] [RISING (Adrenaline)] - Teva confronts him. "I'm going." Her conviction is terrifying. [Milieu: Teva confronts him in the 'echoing, narrow cleft' leading to the Vitarium, where their whispers are 'unnaturally loud'. The air is 'visibly damp' (mist) from the rain.]

3.3 [KEO] [Clandestine Location] [RISING (Resolve)] - Benal arrives, insisting he go. Keo sees Benal's visible terror and is awed by his courage. Keo agrees (loyalty, crush, and now, respect). [Milieu: Benal arrives, 'his tall frame shaking,' clutching a 'biodegradable data-slate'. He's 'gasping' from the run, his poor endurance obvious.]

BEAT 4: BREAK INTO TWO (The Theft)

4.1 [KEO] [His Dwelling (Night)] [HIGH (Guilt)] - Keo looks at his sleeping parents. The weight of his betrayal (the guilt) is the scene's focus. [Milieu: He looks at his parents sleeping on 'woven fern-fiber mats'. He can smell the 'faint, musky scent of their Explorer's gear' (pheromone barrier, sweat, leather) and it fills him with guilt.]

4.2 [KEO] [Suit Repository] [EXTREME (Heist Tension)] - The physical act of the theft. Gazes longingly at metal-tipped spears and other old-tech weapons, but knows that to take them would be the ultimate taboo, has to be satisfied with bio-safe weapons. Nearly getting caught. [Milieu: He takes 'bio-safe' weapons: a '2.5-meter croc-spike' and a 'razor-club'. He has to force himself not to look at the forbidden 'old-tech' metal spears, machetes, and shock-prods.]

4.3 [KEO] [Perimeter] [EXTREME (Resolve)] - Meeting Teva/Benal. Slipping past the watchers. The final, irreversible step into the jungle. [Milieu: A dense, ground-level fog rolls in. As they move, they freeze at the sharp, clicking vocalizations of an *Acheroraptor* pack hunting inside the fog, just meters away (a 'dread' encounter).]

ACT 2: THE MUDWALK (Beats 5-10)

(BEAT 5: B-Story - Woven into all scenes)

BEAT 6: FUN & GAMES (The "Promise of the Premise")

6.1 [TEVA] [Riverbank] [SPIKING (Dread)] - The trio argues about how to cross the first river. Teva's navigation skills and suit give her the authority. [Milieu: The first major rains have begun. The river is visibly swollen, fast, and opaque with mud. The bank is slick, black mud littered with rotting ferns and broken, plate-sized Ginkgo leaves. The rain plasters Teva's hair to her face, but she's grateful it's refilling their water-gourds and washing away the nutty, oily scent of the dried crawlers and piñons in their fieldpacks.]

6.2 [TEVA] [First River] [SPIKING (Panic)] - The crossing. A croc brushes her suit. She fights her suit's thermals and her own terror. [Milieu: A steady, light-to-medium rain continues, 'stippling' the surface and masking their vibrations. She fights the 'warm, suffocating press' of the suit as the croc brushes her, its hide feeling like a rough log.]

6.3 [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [RISING (Dread)] - The environment closes in. His super-senses are overwhelmed. Claustrophobia. [Milieu: A 'bait and switch': a clearing with clouds of hand-sized, iridescent blue butterflies (Lepidoptera), followed by steaming 'sauna-heat' and swarms of 'protein-seeking' flies that crawl on his eyes and mouth.]

6.4 [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [PARALYZING (Panic)] - The Madtsoiidae (constrictor) attack. Pure, silent terror. Keo/Teva save him. [Milieu: The constrictor is 'the color of dead leaves and shadow.' Its attack is 'crushing, breathless silence,' and all he smells is 'the snake's musky reek and his own terror'.]

6.5 [KEO] [Open Savanna] [LOW (Hubris)] - The sunfever trek. Keo (no suit) feels fine, pushing the pace. His bravado is high. He forces a grin at Benal, who is still pale from the snake attack (6.4), "Next time, try not to look so delicious. You're making them hungry." [Milieu: Brutal, unfiltered, midday sun; shimmering heat. The 'savanna' is a sea of 'head-high ferns and cycads'. In the distance, he spots a herd of *Kritosaurus*, 'their calls like low, mournful horns'. His throat is parchment-dry, and he knows they're down to their last half-canteen of water; they need rain, or they'll be in crisis by nightfall.]

6.6 [TEVA] [Open Savanna] [HIGH (Weakness)] - Same trek, her POV. Her suit is struggling with thermal load. She is dizzy, near collapse, but hides it. [Milieu: Her POV: The suit's HUD is 'flickering with red heat warnings.' The sun is 'a physical weight,' and the *Kritosaurus* calls are 'a dull, throbbing headache'.]

BEAT 7: MIDPOINT (Noli's Death)

7.1 [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [LOW (Content)] - A rare moment of peace. Keo is playing with Noli, sharing food. [Milieu: The star-gazing scene: a windless, perfectly clear night. They are eating 'roasted 'grounder' meat' and 'sweet, mealy 'dinosaur-fruit' (*Annonaceae*)'. Noli proudly drags a fresh-killed grounder into camp. Keo roasts the small mammal, and they share the precious carne with foraged 'dinosaur-fruit', a rare and risky feast far better than their dry "journey-pan".]

7.2 [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [SHOCK] - The Quetzalcoatlus attack. It's over in seconds. The sky is empty. [Milieu: The *Quetzalcoatlus* attacks at dawn, using the 'low, blinding sun at its back' to mask its approach. It is a 'sudden, impossible shadow' that moves 'faster than thought'. The pterosaur was almost certainly drawn by the scent of Noli's kill from the night before.]

7.3 [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [GRIEF (Numb)] - The silence. Teva moves his pack for him. Benal just sits nearby. Their quiet, physical presence is the first act of true compassion. [Milieu: The 'deafening, ringing silence' after the attack. Keo is staring at a single, 'blood-spattered purple feather' from Noli. Benal just sits, 'methodically picking a fern apart'.]

BEAT 8: BAD GUYS CLOSE IN

8.1 [TEVA] [Jungle Undergrowth] [HIGH (Dread)] - The shadow of the Quetzalcoatlus passes overhead. They hide. Teva is now terrified of the sky. [Milieu: A drenching, cold rain. They are trapped between the low-flying *Quetzalcoatlus* and a living carpet of 'hell ants' (*Haidomyrmecinae*) moving 'like a single, flowing oil-slick'. Benal, his eyes wide, whispers, "Sky or ground. Pick your death," and Teva whispers back, "Shut up, Benal," but she feels a flash of dark, shared humor. Keo also snorts.]

8.2 [KEO] [Gulch/Ravine] [HIGH (Reckless Rage)] - Keo's injury. He takes a stupid risk trying to climb (e.g., against a pack of Razortails), driven by grief over Noli. [Milieu: The ground is slick, unstable clay from the rain, causing his fall. He was climbing to get a 'lookout', falling onto 'sharp-edged limestone scree' and 'bright red *Gnetophyte* berries'.]

8.3 [TEVA] [Camp (Night)] [HIGH (Exhaustion)] - Tending Keo's wound. Her suit is failing. The "POV Irony" scene (caring for him, while we know he has a crush). As she's tending Keo's wound, he groans, "Careful," and Teva, her hands shaking from cold, snaps, "Be quiet or be bait. Your choice." [Milieu: The cold, miserable, all-night rain continues, threatening Teva's failing thermal regulation. They huddle under a 'leaking roof of waxy fern fronds'.]

8.4 [KEO] [Camp (Night/Fever)] [DISORIENTATION] - Keo's Temporal Flash (the symbol). He's feverish, dismisses it. [Milieu: His Temporal Flash is 'a gleaming, impossible symbol' and the 'smell of ozone and the ocean,' mixed with the 'bitter, herbal taste' of the salve on his wound. Through the fever-haze, he's vaguely aware of Benal sitting watch, his frail form a surprisingly steady silhouette against the rain, and Keo feels a wave of pure gratitude.]

BEAT 9: ALL IS LOST (The Offshore Journey)

9.1 [BENAL] [The Coast] [HIGH (Dread)] - They find the raft. It's a wreck. Benal's absolute terror of the open water. [Milieu: They arrive at low tide: 'a kilometer of treacherous, croc-infested mudflats.' On the horizon: the 'wall of black' of an approaching tropical cyclone. Solution: Benal spots a 'path of chaos'—massive sea turtles laying eggs, creating a 'frenzied distraction' for the crocs, giving them a corridor.]

9.2 [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Panic)] - The storm hits. The raft is tossing. [Milieu: The full fury of the cyclone hits. The raft is an 'old-tech' remnant, 'corroded polymer and metal,' and the waves are 'black, moving mountains'.]

9.3 [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Terror)] - The Mosasaur attacks. The raft shatters. Benal is plunged into the dark water. [Milieu: The *Mosasaur* attacks. He sees its eye, 'as large as his head, ancient and cold.' The 'smell of brine and dead fish' from its breath washes over him. He realizes with a lurch of panic that his fieldpack—containing his math, and all their remaining "journey-pan," dried crawlers, and piñons—is gone, lost to the sea.]

9.4 [BENAL] [Coral Bank (Genesis Site)] [DESPAIR] - Washing up. Battered. Finding Keo, then Teva. They've "failed." [Milieu: They wash up in the 'eerie, unnatural calm of the cyclone's eye.' The bank is 'razor-sharp fossilized rudist bivalves' and 'black volcanic rock'. Small, iridescent crabs scatter.]

BEAT 10: DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

10.1 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Cold)] - Huddling, freezing. The disorientation is strong. Teva's Flash (the schism). [Milieu: Flooded by the cyclone's storm surge. The 'temporal disorientation' is 'a physical, nauseating pull, like the world is tilted.' The water is full of 'floating, shredded palm fronds'. She's not just cold; she's weak, her stomach a "hollow, aching knot" from two days of hunger, and the salty, undrinkable floodwater is a mockery of their thirst.]

10.2 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Numb)] - The silence after the flash. Keo speaks: "I destroyed my family..." [Milieu: Keo's voice is 'a hoarse croak,' his guilt 'raw and exposed.' Teva can see 'the dark, bruised line of his injury' through his torn tunic.]

10.3 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Connecting)] - Benal confesses his shame. Keo makes the connection. [Milieu: Benal's confession is 'barely a whisper,' but in the 'dead, flooded silence,' it 'sounds like a shout.' He is 'shaking so hard his teeth chatter'.]

10.4 [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [COMPASSION] - Teva's "bridge" speech ("You're lucky..."). The "chosen family" is forged. [Milieu: Her 'bridge' speech. She 'pulls her knees to her chest,' trying to stop shivering, her compassion 'a small, warm thing' in the 'crushing cold'.]

ACT 3: Genesis & THE RETURN (Beats 11-15)

BEAT 11: BREAK INTO THREE (The First Win)

11.1 [BENAL] [Archive (Exploring)] [RISING (Curiosity)] - Benal follows his senses (the hum, the scent). Finding the sealed hatch. [Milieu: Benal follows a 'faint, high-frequency hum' (that only he can hear) and the 'clean, sterile scent of filtered air' to a 'perfectly dry, sealed hatch' marked with a 'faded logo'.]

11.2 [BENAL] [Archive (Sealed Lab)] [AWE/TRIUMPH] - The lab is dry, powered. The metal tablets. "I found it. I found the protocols." After Benal says "I found it," Keo just stares at the metal tablets and whispers, "Huh. So your math isn't useless after all," and Benal, for the first time, grins. [Milieu: The lab is 'bathed in the steady, white light of old-tech'. The metal tablets are 'cool to the touch.' He sees a 'large, iridescent, long-horned beetle' (Coleoptera) on a console.]

BEAT 12: FINALE (The Revelation)

12.1 [BENAL] [Archive (Temporal Lab)] [AWE] - Finding the mission logs (the perfect arrival). The "lie" is revealed. [Milieu: He sees 'a wall of dead consoles' and one 'still faintly powered,' showing a 'corrupted star-chart' and the 'mission logs'.]

12.2 [BENAL] [Archive (Temporal Lab)] [DREAD (Frustration)] - The "impossible equation." He's stuck. [Milieu: The 'impossible equation' is on a 'scratched, damaged metal plate,' half-obscured by 'a dried, dark stain' (blood?).]

12.3 [BENAL] [Archive (Temporal Lab)] [EPIPHANY] - Keo/Teva's "chance comment." It connects everything: the equation, his flash (Beat 10), Keo's flash (Beat 8.4). The "Noble Lie" and the real mission become clear. [Milieu: Keo's 'chance comment' makes Benal's mind 'click.' He sees the 'symbol from Keo's fever dream' on the console and 'understands.' It's 'not a symbol, it's a coordinate'.]

BEAT 13: THE RETURN (The Heretic's Ride)

13.1 [KEO] [Archive (Hangar)] [RISING (Heresy)] - Finding the skiff. The debate is nonexistent. This is the only way. [Milieu: The skiff is 'all gray metal and sharp angles,' covered in '200 years of dust and grime.' A 'massive, intricate spider web' (Araneae) is strung from the landing strut.]

13.2 [KEO] [Skiff (Mangroves)] [HIGH (Action)] - The Quetzalcoatlus (Noli's killer) attacks. The chase begins. [Milieu: They fly low over a 'massive, thundering migration of *Alamosaurus*' that is being 'paced' by a *T-Rex* (a 'dread' encounter). The *Alamosaurus* are 'like walking, gray mountains,' their 'booming, resonant calls' vibrating in his chest.]

13.3 [KEO] [Skiff (Canyon/River)] [EXTREME (Action)] - Keo's redemption. He's not just a "brute"; he's a pilot. He uses the tech to execute a brilliant maneuver, defeating the pterosaur. As Keo evades the pterosaur, Teva, gripping her seat, just watches him, her terror momentarily replaced by raw awe at his focus—this is the pilot he was meant to be. [Milieu: He pulls the skiff into a 'hard, banking turn,' the 'g-force pressing him into the seat.' He sees the *QuetzalDcoatlus* 'overshoot, its vast, leathery wing' blocking the sun as it 'screams in frustration'.]

BEAT 14: THE CONFRONTATION

14.1 [KEO] [Enclave (Landing Area)] [HIGH (Social Confrontation)] - The skiff lands. The stunned silence. The walk through the crowd. He sees his parents, under guard. [Milieu: Clear, bright, 'cleansed' air after the storm. The 'high-pitched whine of the skiff's engine' makes everyone 'clap their hands over their ears'.]

14.2 [TEVA] [Council Chamber] [HIGH (Vindication)] - Her POV. She slams the protocols on the table. The accusation. "You were wrong." [Milieu: She slams the 'heavy, metal protocol tablets' on the 'worn wooden council table,' the 'clang' echoing in the 'stunned silence'.]

14.3 [TEVA] [Council Chamber] [EPIPHANY] - Her POV. She sees the Council's faces. They match her flash (Beat 10). Her "Rage to Nuance" arc clicks. They aren't liars; they're frightened believers. [Milieu: Her epiphany. The Council's faces are 'not cruel, just old, and tired, and terrified.' She sees her grandmother, Omya, in the crowd, looking 'confused, but faintly proud'.]

14.4 [BENAL] [Council Chamber] [HIGH (Vindication)] - His POV. He steps forward to explain the temporal truth. He sees his parents' faces change from pity to awe. His arc is complete. [Milieu: He steps forward, 'no longer stooping,' and 'speaks with a clear, steady voice' for the first time, his gaze finding his father, Marek, in the crowd.]

BEAT 15: FINAL IMAGE

15.1 [KEO] [Council Chamber] [LOW (Determination)] - Back to Keo. He surveys the new power dynamic. His parents' pride. The Council's terror. He stands with his family. The end. [Milieu: Keo stands 'shoulder-to-shoulder' with Teva and Benal. He is 'no longer a child,' but 'a heretic, and a leader.' He sees his parents, 'their faces a mask of terror and shocking pride'.]
