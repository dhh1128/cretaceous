## Scene 2.1

Pheromone Barrier: It is an "amber-colored synthesis" that mimics two things: 1) The musk of a dominant male Tyrannosaurus, and 2) The chemical markers of "sepsis and necrotic tissue."

Barrier Function (T. rex): Signals a "risky, unprofitable fight" against a "wounded, sick, and violently unpredictable" alpha.

Barrier Function (Razortail/Dromaeosaur): Signals "The apex predator is here, it is wounded, and it is angry. Flee or die."

Noli's Reaction: Primal panic. She must be forced by Keo's mental projection to be near it.

Keo's Projection: Is powerful enough to override a core survival instinct, but it is physically and mentally taxing ("like holding a boulder on a hilltop," "pressure behind his eyes," "staggered a step"). He can also "partition" his mind to perform two mental tasks at once (suppress panic + send a command), though this is difficult.

## Scene 2.2

Benal's Math: He is working on "temporal anchoring," specifically the problem of "temporal drift" which he theorizes is related to "cosmic expansion." He believes the originals anchored to space not spacetime. This is his core intellectual pursuit.

Benal's Upgrades (Sensory): His hearing is a burden. It's not "super-hearing" like in a comic book; it's an unfiltered flood he must actively manage. This is a key character trait.

Marek's Philosophy (Brancher): He is not a villain. He is a pragmatic, loving father who believes the "mission" is a "noble lie." His core value is here-and-now survival. His core emotion toward Benal is pity.

Dwelling Details: Confirmed as 30m high in Araucaria (monkey puzzle) trees, with roof-thatch to protect from flybeaks.
