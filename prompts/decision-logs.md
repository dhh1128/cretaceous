# Cretaceous - Decision Log (v3)

This document tracks specific narrative decisions made during drafting that are not fully captured in the Milieu Brief or Character Profiles. Consult this to ensure continuity in future chapters.

## World-Building & Mechanics

### The Vitarium (Scene 1.1)
* **Gel Color Coding:**
    * **Rust-Red:** T-Cell Activation Vector (Immunity). The critical failure point.
    * **Blue:** Lysine/Digestive protocols (Nutritional/Pan).
* **Sensory Detail:** The smell of failure is described as "sweet, denatured-protein decay."

### Old-Tech & Repository (Scene 4.2)
* **Location:** The Repository is a bunker dug *beneath* the roots of a massive coniferale, secured by a limestone slab with a counterweight system (air bladder assist).
* **Containment Protocol:** Old-tech weapons are wrapped in bindings impregnated with "dormant, engineered archaea." If the weekly nutrient balm is missed (or the item is lost/abandoned), the archaea activate and dissolve the metal/polymer into organic sludge. This prevents paradoxes from lost gear.
* **Suit Activation:** Suits are step-in. Secured by pulling an "old-tech sealant tab" which hisses shut.

### Telepathy & Population (Scene 2.1)
* **Census:** The Enclave population is established as exactly **941 minds** at the start of the story.
* **Projection Limits:** Keo's mental projection requires "partitioning" his mind. It causes physical symptoms (pressure behind eyes).

## History & Lore

### The "First Walk" (Scene 3.1)
* **Timeline:** It took the Founders 3 years of scouting to find the Enclave site.
* **Casualties:** They lost 106 souls (out of ~200) despite having environmental suits and plasma cutters.
* **Rhetoric:** Traditionalists (Elder Sila) frame the mission as "Better to die with a clean soul than live as contaminants."

## Plot Specifics

### The Inventory (Scene 4.2 & 4.3)
* **Keo's Gear:** Carries a 2.5m croc-spike, a razor-club, and a chert knife. He is **unsuited**.
* **Teva's Gear:** Suited. Carries a croc-spike.
* **Benal's Gear:** Suited. Carries a razor-club (awkwardly) and a sling. He forgot protein, only brought "journey-pan" (cycad flatbread).
* **Medical Supplies:** Benal is carrying the salves and chemical-pods.

### Mathematics (Scene 2.2)
* **The Equation:** $T_d = T_o \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \cdot (f_{drift}?)$.
* **The Theory:** Benal posits the Founders anchored to a point in *space*, not *spacetime*, failing to account for cosmic expansion/drift. This is the "Asymptotic Noise" he hears.

## Character Nuance & Themes (Established in Act 1)

### Teva: The "Monsters" Dichotomy (Scene 3.1)
* **Thematic Mantra:** Teva frames the conflict as "Monsters in the water" (tangible threats like crocs, which the village fears) vs. "Monsters in the blood" (the virus/infection, which the village ignores).
* **Motivation:** Her journey is explicitly driven by the belief that the adults are fighting the wrong monster.

### Benal & Marek (Scene 2.2)
* **Marek's Attitude:** Marek is not a villain; he views the mission as a "Noble Lie." His primary emotion toward Benal is **pity**, not malice. This pity is Benal's primary antagonist.
* **Benal's Sensory Burden:** His hearing is treated as an "unfiltered assault" that he must actively manage, not a passive superpower.

### Keo: The Custodian's Guilt (Scene 4.1)
* **Theft Weight:** Keo views the theft of the suits not just as a crime, but as a destruction of his parents' specific role as Custodians. This specific guilt (destroying their reputation) will weigh on him.

## Character Connections
* **Liaso:** A Watcher, identified as Benal's cousin. (Scene 4.2).
* **Joram & Riel:** Keo's parents. Riel has the proximity sense; Joram is the heavy sleeper.
