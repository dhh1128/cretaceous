## Scene 2.1

Pheromone Barrier: It is an "amber-colored synthesis" that mimics two things: 1) The musk of a dominant male Tyrannosaurus, and 2) The chemical markers of "sepsis and necrotic tissue."

Barrier Function (T. rex): Signals a "risky, unprofitable fight" against a "wounded, sick, and violently unpredictable" alpha.

Barrier Function (Razortail/Dromaeosaur): Signals "The apex predator is here, it is wounded, and it is angry. Flee or die."

Noli's Reaction: Primal panic. She must be forced by Keo's mental projection to be near it.

Keo's Projection: Is powerful enough to override a core survival instinct, but it is physically and mentally taxing ("like holding a boulder on a hilltop," "pressure behind his eyes," "staggered a step"). He can also "partition" his mind to perform two mental tasks at once (suppress panic + send a command), though this is difficult.

## Scene 2.2

Benal's Math: He is working on "temporal anchoring," specifically the problem of "temporal drift" which he theorizes is related to "cosmic expansion." He believes the originals anchored to space not spacetime. This is his core intellectual pursuit.

Benal's Upgrades (Sensory): His hearing is a burden. It's not "super-hearing" like in a comic book; it's an unfiltered flood he must actively manage. This is a key character trait.

Marek's Philosophy (Brancher): He is not a villain. He is a pragmatic, loving father who believes the "mission" is a "noble lie." His core value is here-and-now survival. His core emotion toward Benal is pity.

Nest Details: Confirmed as 30m high in Araucaria (monkey puzzle) trees, with woven vine walls, fern privacy screen dividers between rooms, and roof thatch to protect from flybeaks.

## Scene 2.3
Location: The "Yazhi Pool" is now a canon location within the Enclave village core. It's a fenced/barricaded section of a natural creek, not an artificial trough.

Characterization (Teva): Her "cold rage" manifests as emotional detachment, numbness, and a terrifyingly cold, precise anger (rather than hot-tempered yelling). She is a "precision" language user when teaching.

Thematic Line: The "monsters in the blood" vs. "monsters in the water" is the central thematic driver for Teva's motivation.

Plot: The plan to recruit Keo and Benal is now fully formed in Teva's mind before she confronts them in Beat 3. She is the plan's architect.

## Scene 3.1

Canon Names: Elder Hesh and Elder Sila are now the primary voices of the Traditionalist Council.

The "First Walk": This is now the canon term for the original, disastrous 80km migration from Genesis to the Enclave.

First Walk Stats: Left Genesis with 200 people, arrived at Enclave with 94. (Loss of 106).

Elana's Role: Her grief is now a key catalyst, cementing the "paralysis" for Keo.

Council Chamber: Confirmed as a small, claustrophobic recess with no carvings, by deliberate choice.

## Scene 3.2
Teva's Motivation: It's a combination of her grandmother's failure (emotional drive) and a cold, tactical assessment of her and Keo's upgrades (practical drive).

Keo's Agreement: It's not a "brave" choice. It's a compulsive one, driven by his inability to let her die alone. His panic of going is simply less powerful than his panic of staying.

Teva's Characterization: Her "cold rage" (from outline) manifests here as "cold, structural certainty." She is the "architect" of the plan (from decision logs).

## Scene 3.3

Kiva Entrance (Canon): It is a natural cleft, draped with a heavy ceratops hide.

Enclave Environment (Canon): The night often fills with bioluminescent insects.

Teva's Pitch (Canon): She explicitly lists their shared baseline upgrades (immunity, metabolism, venom resistance) and her specific navigation/survival upgrades (magnetism, proprioception) as the reason the "First Walk" statistics don't apply to them.

Keo's Experience (Canon): He has been outside the border tangle on patrols and has a concrete, sensory-based fear of the apex predators.
