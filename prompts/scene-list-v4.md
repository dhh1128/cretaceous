# Cretaceous - Scene List (v4)

This document breaks down the 15-beat outline (v10) into a granular, 40-scene list. Each scene is a distinct unit of action with a specific POV. Specific B-Story notes accompany each A-Story scene for pacing and character arc consistency.

Format: [Scene #] [Day #] [POV Character] [Location] [Fear Level (and/or Key Emotion)] [Milieu Note]
* **B-Story Note:** Focus on the internal/interpersonal conflict specific to this moment.

## ACT 1: THE FAILING WORLD (Beats 1-4)

### BEAT 1: COLD OPEN (The Catalyst)

1.1 [Day 1 - Evening] [TEVA] [Vitarium (Kiva)] [HIGH (Grief & Rage)] - Teva watches the dimming cultures as her grandmother fails the protocol. The yazhi dies. Teva's internal rage solidifies.
* **B-Story Note:** Surface Teva's core trauma. The death of the yazhi, Alira, should be an emotional echo of her past losses, solidifying her motivation: **Rage vs. Council**.

### BEAT 2: UNSETTLED NORMALCY & SET-UP

2.1 [Day 2 - Morning] [KEO] [Enclave Perimeter] [LOW (Anxiety)] - Keo trains Noli. His bravado (masking anxiety) is evident.
* **B-Story Note:** Establish Keo’s **Bravado Mask** and his exceptional **Mental Projection** ability through his interaction with Noli. The underlying anxiety about the crisis must simmer beneath his confident exterior.

2.2 [Day 2 - Morning] [BENAL] [Family Dwelling] [LOW (Frustration)] - Benal studies his math. His parent's dismissal ("do something real"). His shame/isolation.
* **B-Story Note:** Directly address **Benal's Shame** and intellectual **Isolation**. Marek's (Benal's father) pity, not malice, is Benal's primary antagonist. His theoretical work is framed as "useless" compared to the practical survival of the Branchers.

2.3 [Day 2 - Morning] [TEVA] [Village Center (Yazhi Pool)] [LOW (Cold Rage)] - Teva drills yazhi on croc protocols. Her internal monologue contrasts the "useless" drill with the real threat (the plague). [Milieu: A sudden, driving, warm rainstorm. The rain comes down in sheets, and the yazhi (Joss, Miri) huddle under a leaking fern-thatch roof. Teva welcomes the respite from her overheating.]
* **B-Story Note:** Define Teva's **Thematic Mantra**: "Monsters in the water" (crocs) vs. "Monsters in the blood" (the plague). Her internal rage focuses on the adults fighting the wrong monster.

### BEAT 3: THE DEBATE (Public & Private)

3.1 [Day 2 - Evening] [KEO] [Council Chamber] [RISING (Frustration)] - Keo attends the public Council meeting. He witnesses the adults' paralysis and fear.
* **B-Story Note:** **Skills Clash (Generational)**. Keo judges the Council's paralysis and fear. He sees their adherence to Traditionalist rhetoric (Elder Sila's "clean soul" speech) as intellectual weakness.

3.2 [Day 2 - Night] [KEO] [Clandestine Location (Kiva entrance)] [RISING (Adrenaline)] - Teva confronts him. "I'm going." Her conviction is terrifying. [Milieu: Teva confronts him in the 'echoing, narrow cleft' leading to the Vitarium, where their whispers are 'unnaturally loud'. The air is 'visibly damp' (mist) from the rain.]
* **B-Story Note:** Establish the **Unrequited Romance** from Keo's perspective. Teva's resolve is his primary motivation for the journey.

3.3 [Day 2 - Night] [KEO] [Clandestine Location] [RISING (Resolve)] - Benal arrives, insisting he go. He is visibly terrified, but his one chance at vindication is stronger than his fear. Keo agrees (loyalty, crush, and now, respect). [Milieu: Benal arrives, 'his tall frame shaking,' clutching a 'biodegradable data-slate'. He's 'gasping' from the run, his poor endurance obvious.]
* **B-Story Note:** Establish **Intellectual Respect**. Keo sees Benal's fear but is "awed" by his courage, validating Benal's abstract motive over physical limits.

### BEAT 4: BREAK INTO TWO (The Theft)

4.1 [Day 2 - Late Night] [KEO] [His Dwelling (Night)] [HIGH (Guilt)] - Keo looks at his sleeping parents. The weight of his betrayal (the guilt) is the scene's focus. [Milieu: He looks at his parents sleeping on 'woven fern-fiber mats'. He can smell the 'faint, musky scent of their Explorer's gear' (pheromone barrier, sweat, leather) and it fills him with guilt.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Shared Guilt (Keo's Weight)**. The guilt is specifically tied to destroying his parents', Joram and Riel's, reputation as Custodians, rather than just the crime of theft.

4.2 [Day 2 - Late Night] [KEO] [Suit Repository] [EXTREME (Heist Tension)] - The physical act of the theft. Gazes longingly at metal-tipped spears and other old-tech weapons, but knows that to take them would be the ultimate taboo, has to be satisfied with bio-safe weapons. Nearly getting caught. [Milieu: He takes 'bio-safe' weapons: a '2.5-meter croc-spike' and a 'razor-club'. He has to force himself not to look at the forbidden 'old-tech' metal spears, machetes, and shock-prods.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Commitment to Heresy**. The choice to leave the "old-tech" weapons establishes the constraints of the Traditionalist mission (avoiding paradoxes) and Keo's current compliance with that ideology, despite the theft.

4.3 [Day 2 - Pre-Dawn] [KEO] [Perimeter] [EXTREME (Resolve)] - Meeting Teva/Benal. Slipping past the watchers. The final, irreversible step into the jungle. [Milieu: A dense, ground-level fog rolls in. As they move, they freeze at the sharp, clicking vocalizations of an *Acheroraptor* pack hunting inside the fog, just meters away (a 'dread' encounter).]
* **B-Story Note:** **The Final Step**. The physical proximity of the *Acheroraptor* pack (razortails) immediately validates the fear-driven decision to steal the suits.

## ACT 2: THE MUDWALK (Beats 5-10)

### BEAT 5: B-STORY (Immediate Fallout)

5.1 [Day 2 - Morning] [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [EXTREME (Panic/Crash)] - The raptor escape, the adrenaline dump, and the beginning of the mudwalk.
* **B-Story Note:** **Skills Clash (The First Failure)**. Keo's unrefined mental projection attempt is reckless and fails to achieve control, validating Teva’s immediate pragmatism. Benal’s body fails (vomiting/collapse), forcing him to articulate Keo’s recklessness ("reckless, unsuited idiot"). Teva validates Benal's intellect, forging their nascent bond.

### BEAT 6: FUN & GAMES (The "Promise of the Premise")

6.1 [Day 3] [TEVA] [Riverbank] [SPIKING (Dread)] - The trio argues about how to cross the first river. Teva's navigation skills and suit give her the authority. [Milieu: The first major rains have begun. The river is visibly swollen, fast, and opaque with mud. The bank is slick, black mud littered with rotting ferns and broken, plate-sized Ginkgo leaves. The rain plasters Teva's hair to her face, but she's grateful it's refilling their water-gourds and washing away the nutty, oily scent of the dried crawlers and piñons in their fieldpacks.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Skills Clash (Practical vs. Bravado)**. Teva’s magnetic sense and proprioception establish her as the competent leader/navigator. She internally dismisses Keo’s unsuited bravado as a dangerous liability near the water (the **Primary Threat**).

6.2 [Day 3] [TEVA] [First River] [SPIKING (Panic)] - The crossing. A croc brushes her suit. She fights her suit's thermals and her own terror. [Milieu: A steady, light-to-medium rain continues, 'stippling' the surface and masking their vibrations. She fights the 'warm, suffocating press' of the suit as the croc brushes her, its hide feeling like a rough log.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Shared Guilt**. Teva's internal terror is linked to the Council's paralysis and the death of the yazhi, reinforcing her conviction that they were right to leave.

6.3 [Day 4] [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [RISING (Dread)] - The environment closes in. His super-senses are overwhelmed. Claustrophobia. [Milieu: A 'bait and switch': a clearing with clouds of hand-sized, iridescent blue butterflies (Lepidoptera), followed by steaming 'sauna-heat' and swarms of 'protein-seeking' flies that crawl on his eyes and mouth.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Sensory Burden / Isolation**. Benal's enhanced hearing is an "unfiltered assault", transforming the jungle into an aggressive environment. This isolation (being the only one experiencing the full assault) heightens his shame.

6.4 [Day 5] [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [PARALYZING (Panic)] - The Madtsoiidae (constrictor) attack. Pure, silent terror. Keo/Teva save him. [Milieu: The constrictor is 'the color of dead leaves and shadow.' Its attack is 'crushing, breathless silence,' and all he smells is 'the snake's musky reek and his own terror'.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Reliance / Debt**. Benal’s fear is paralyzing. His salvation by his friends' physical skills deepens his realization of his physical failure and his dependence on their **Chosen Family** strength.

6.5 [Day 7] [KEO] [Open Savanna] [LOW (Hubris)] - The sunfever trek. Keo (no suit) feels fine, pushing the pace. His bravado is high. He forces a grin at Benal, who is still pale from the snake attack (6.4), "Next time, try not to look so delicious. You're making them hungry." [Milieu: Brutal, unfiltered, midday sun; shimmering heat. The 'savanna' is a sea of 'head-high ferns and cycads'. In the distance, he spots a herd of *Kritosaurus*, 'their calls like low, mournful horns'. His throat is parchment-dry, and he knows they're down to their last half-canteen of water; they need rain, or they'll be in crisis by nightfall.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Unrequited Romance / Hubris Climax**. Keo's internal monologue is dominated by his pride in his **Thermal Regulation** upgrade and his desire to prove himself capable to Teva without the "crutch" of the suit. This is the apex of his **Hubris** arc.

6.6 [Day 7] [TEVA] [Open Savanna] [HIGH (Weakness)] - Same trek, her POV. Her suit is struggling with thermal load. She is dizzy, near collapse, but hides it. [Milieu: Her POV: The suit's HUD is 'flickering with red heat warnings.' The sun is 'a physical weight,' and the *Kritosaurus* calls are 'a dull, throbbing headache'.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Skills Clash (Vulnerability)**. Teva must hide her **Poor Thermal Regulation** failure, ironically making her (the suited one) more vulnerable than Keo.

### BEAT 7: MIDPOINT (Noli's Death)

7.1 [Day 7 - Night] [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [LOW (Content)] - A rare moment of peace. Keo is playing with Noli, sharing food. [Milieu: The star-gazing scene: a windless, perfectly clear night. They are eating 'roasted 'grounder' meat' and 'sweet, mealy 'dinosaur-fruit' (*Annonaceae*)'. Noli proudly drags a fresh-killed grounder into camp. Keo roasts the small mammal, and they share the precious carne with foraged 'dinosaur-fruit', a rare and risky feast far better than their dry "journey-pan".]
* **B-Story Note:** **False Peace**. Establish the trio as a functional unit and Noli as a key part of their internal camaraderie before the crisis.

7.2 [Day 8 - Dawn] [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [SHOCK] - The Quetzalcoatlus attack. It's over in seconds. The sky is empty. [Milieu: The *Quetzalcoatlus* attacks at dawn, using the 'low, blinding sun at its back' to mask its approach. It is a 'sudden, impossible shadow' that moves 'faster than thought'. The pterosaur was almost certainly drawn by the scent of Noli's kill from the night before.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Noli's Loss**. The failure is absolute and vertical. Keo's **Mental Projection** is utterly useless, shattering his confidence and marking the end of the "adventure."

7.3 [Day 8 - Dawn] [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [GRIEF (Numb)] - The silence. Teva moves his pack for him. Benal just sits nearby. Their quiet, physical presence is the first act of true compassion. [Milvieu: The 'deafening, ringing silence' after the attack. Keo is staring at a single, 'blood-spattered purple feather' from Noli. Benal just sits, 'methodically picking a fern apart'.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Chosen Family Bond**. The compassion from Teva and Benal in his grief moves their relationship past **Shared Guilt** into a truly positive bond.

### BEAT 8: BAD GUYS CLOSE IN

8.1 [Day 8] [TEVA] [Jungle Undergrowth] [HIGH (Dread)] - The shadow of the Quetzalcoatlus passes overhead. They hide. Teva is now terrified of the sky. [Milieu: A drenching, cold rain. They are trapped between the low-flying *Quetzalcoatlus* and a living carpet of 'hell ants' (*Haidomyrmecinae*) moving 'like a single, flowing oil-slick'. Benal, his eyes wide, whispers, "Sky or ground. Pick your death," and Teva whispers back, "Shut up, Benal," but she feels a flash of dark, shared humor. Keo also snorts.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Shared Humor / Terror**. The shared, dark humor provides brief, cathartic release from the mounting dread.

8.2 [Day 8] [KEO] [Gulch/Ravine] [HIGH (Reckless Rage)] - Keo's injury. He takes a stupid risk trying to climb (e.g., against a pack of Razortails), driven by grief over Noli. [Milieu: The ground is slick, unstable clay from the rain, causing his fall. He was climbing to get a 'lookout', falling onto 'sharp-edged limestone scree' and 'bright red *Gnetophyte* berries'.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Hubris Crash**. Keo's injury is the direct consequence of his **unsuited state** and his unresolved **Grief/Rage** over Noli's death. He is forced into vulnerability.

8.3 [Day 8 - Night] [TEVA] [Camp (Night)] [HIGH (Exhaustion)] - Tending Keo's wound. Her suit is failing. The "POV Irony" scene (caring for him, while we know he has a crush). As she's tending Keo's wound, he groans, "Careful," and Teva, her hands shaking from cold, snaps, "Be quiet or be bait. Your choice." [Milieu: The cold, miserable, all-night rain continues, threatening Teva's failing thermal regulation. They huddle under a 'leaking roof of waxy fern fronds'.]
* **B-Story Note:** **POV Irony / Caretaker Climax**. Teva's emotional state (exhaustion, rising fear, but forced competence) conflicts with Keo's perception of her. She embodies the compassionate role, which develops the **Romance Subtext** through action, not words.

8.4 [Day 8 - Night] [KEO] [Camp (Night/Fever)] [DISORIENTATION] - Keo's Temporal Flash (the symbol). He's feverish, dismisses it. [Milieu: His Temporal Flash is 'a gleaming, impossible symbol' and the 'smell of ozone and the ocean,' mixed with the 'bitter, herbal taste' of the salve on his wound. Through the fever-haze, he's vaguely aware of Benal sitting watch, his frail form a surprisingly steady silhouette against the rain, and Keo feels a wave of pure gratitude.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Shame/Gratitude**. Keo's vulnerability forces him to rely on Benal's silent watchfulness, generating a wave of **gratitude** that cuts through his earlier hubris and arrogance.

### BEAT 9: ALL IS LOST (The Offshore Journey)

9.1 [Day 11] [BENAL] [The Coast] [HIGH (Dread)] - They find the raft. It's a wreck. Benal's absolute terror of the open water. [Milieu: They arrive at low tide: 'a kilometer of treacherous, croc-infested mudflats.' On the horizon: the 'wall of black' of an approaching tropical cyclone. Solution: Benal spots a 'path of chaos'—massive sea turtles laying eggs, creating a 'frenzied distraction' for the crocs, giving them a corridor.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Skills Clash (Intellectual Value)**. Benal's **Superb Smell/Hearing** allows him to detect the chaos of the coast (croc paths, egg-laying turtles) and propose a clever, pragmatic solution, proving his value in a survival context.

9.2 [Day 11 - Night] [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Panic)] - The storm hits. The raft is tossing. [Milieu: The full fury of the cyclone hits. The raft is an 'old-tech' remnant, 'corroded polymer and metal,' and the waves are 'black, moving mountains'.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Thematic Fear**. Benal's most primal fear is realized: chaos, drowning, and physical helplessness.

9.3 [Day 11 - Night] [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Terror)] - The Mosasaur attacks. The raft shatters. Benal is plunged into the dark water. [Milieu: The *Mosasaur* attacks. He sees its eye, 'as large as his head, ancient and cold.' The 'smell of brine and dead fish' from its breath washes over him. He realizes with a lurch of panic that his fieldpack—containing his math, and all their remaining "journey-pan," dried crawlers, and piñons—is gone, lost to the sea.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Intellectual Loss**. The loss of his fieldpack (and his theoretical work) symbolizes the loss of his last physical connection to his **Vindication** arc, reinforcing his belief in failure.

9.4 [Day 12 - Dawn] [BENAL] [Coral Bank (Genesis Site)] [DESPAIR] - Washing up. Battered. Finding Keo, then Teva. They've "failed." [Milieu: They wash up in the 'eerie, unnatural calm of the cyclone's eye.' The bank is 'razor-sharp fossilized rudist bivalves' and 'black volcanic rock'. Small, iridescent crabs scatter.]
* **B-Story Note:** **Ultimate Defeat**. The collective belief that they have failed their mission and sacrificed their families for nothing.

### BEAT 10: DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

10.1 [Day 12] [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Cold)] - Huddling, freezing. The disorientation is strong.
* **B-Story Note:** **B-Story Climax: Chosen Family Forged**. The trio's mutual, honest confessions of **Guilt** (Keo), **Shame** (Benal's pity), and **Despair** (Teva’s grandmother). Teva provides the emotional **Bridge Speech**, transforming them from allies into a **Chosen Family** unit. Her flash reveals the ancestors’ *fear* and *grief*, planting the first seed of her **Nuance** arc.

## ACT 3: GENESIS & THE RETURN (Beats 11-15)

### BEAT 11: BREAK INTO THREE

11.1 [Day 12 - Morning] [BENAL] [Archive (Dry Section)] [AWE & TRIUMPH] - They find a dry, powered section of Genesis and the complete synthesis protocols.
* **B-Story Note:** **Vindication (Part 1)**. Immediate, physical validation of their journey's purpose. The **Intellectual** triumph of finding the *solution* is a brief, shared high.

### BEAT 12: FINALE (The Revelation)

12.1 [Day 12 - Afternoon] [BENAL] [Temporal Lab] [AWE -> INTELLECTUAL DREAD] - They find the logs of the perfect arrival. Benal connects his equation to the temporal flash, realizing the "Noble Lie" and the "impossible new mission".
* **B-Story Note:** **Vindication (Part 2)**. The final validation of Benal’s "useless" work. His intellectual ability is now the most important resource, shifting the power dynamic in the trio.

### BEAT 13: THE RETURN (The Heretic's Ride)

13.1 [Day 13 - Morning] [KEO] [Skiff (Return Trip)] [EXTREME (Action / Adrenaline)] - They find a functional old-tech skiff. The chase sequence, ending with Keo defeating/evading the *Quetzalcoatlus*.
* **B-Story Note:** **Hubris to Competence / Embrace of Hard Tech**. Keo's action climax: he successfully pilots the forbidden **old-tech** to defeat the monster that broke his confidence, completing his arc and confirming his commitment to the "heretical" way forward.

### BEAT 14: THE CONFRONTATION

14.1 [Day 13 - Evening] [KEO] [Enclave Kiva] [HIGH (Social Confrontation)] - They arrive, provide the protocols, and confront the Council with the truth of the "Noble Lie".
* **B-Story Note:** **Maturation Climax / Nuance Forged**. Keo’s perspective focuses on his parents’ reaction (vindicated pride). Teva's accusation is softened by her internal epiphany: seeing the Council's paralyzed fear and realizing the lie was born from grief, not malice, completing her **Rage to Nuance** arc. Benal stands vindicated.

### BEAT 15: FINAL IMAGE

15.1 [Day 13 - Night] [KEO] [Council Chamber] [DETERMINATION] - The stunned Council and their parents. The trio stands together, no longer children.
* **B-Story Note:** **The New Schism**. The final image of the trio standing as a unified, powerful unit—a **Chosen Family**—now facing the political fallout of their actions, ready to lead the *new* mission.
