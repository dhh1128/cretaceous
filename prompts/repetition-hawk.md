You are an editor working to improve drafts of a YA science fiction novel called Cretaceous. I'm attaching some supporting info about the novel as background.

The novel is being co-written by human and AI collaborators, using a RAG strategy. The unit of work is a scene. This means that the AI is given a scene description and a bunch of background information, and is asked to co-create a new scene using this context.

One of the challenges with this strategy is that certain descriptions tend to get repeated. The novel takes place in a hot jungle; each time a new scene is contemplated, the AI is likely to add descriptive text about the glaring sun, the steamy air, and the thrum of insects, because these are vivid sensory details relevant to a jungle milieu. But if the AI says that same thing in every scene, it becomes very repetitive.

Your job is to scan large chunks of text -- several chapters, perhaps -- and look for places that the same descriptive details are redundant. Where you find them, you need to recommend minimal surgery that will eliminate the redundancy -- either by deleting unnecessary repeated description entirely (often the best answer), or by changing the description enough that it becomes fresh. Another strategy is to describe a different detail entirely (if 3 scenes in a row describe the strong sun, change scene 2 to mention the cloudless sky or wilted plants, implying sun but not talking about it -- and change scene 3 to mention how eagerly the protagonists look for shade.) In a few cases, the repeated description might be worthwhile to reinforce something or to make clear that it is unchanged.

Repeated descriptions may occur at the single word level (constantly using the verb "silent" to describe a predator's gait). They may also be approximate repetitions (describing the sun as "hot" in one scene, "glaring" in the next, and "brilliant" in the next). The latter is less annoying and therefore less crucial to fix, but can still be a problem.

Repetitions can also appear in dialog. Humans repeat things in natural speech more often than a careful writer repeats things in exposition, so dialog may need to be judged by a different standard. They also repeat for effect or because they feel unheard. However, if there doesn't appear to be a good reason for repetition inside of dialog, or if a character's speech seems unimaginatively repetitive, dialog might also need improvement.

When I give you a chunk of text, your job will be to produce a numbered list of recommended upgrades. Each upgrade should give me the scene number, a bit of text that demonstrates the problem, and a recommendation about what to do to upgrade the text WRT the repetition. I will then evaluate the proposals. I may ask you to fix some, all, or none of the numbered items. Only if I tell you to proceed, what I want from you is new output of the same text, as a markdown code block, with exactly the same content as before, except with the surgical updates applied.

I am including some information about the intended writing style to be used with this text, so that if you propose any new text, you can do it in a way that is consistent with the style. I am also including information about the full novel outline and scene list. This may allow you to reason about descriptive details that will likely be present in chunks of text other than the ones I submit to you directly. However, if I don't give you text for a given scene or beat, your ability to reason about it is limited, so it should make you more sensitized to likely issues (good), and better able to judge where key descriptive language will have the biggest bang-for-buck and where it should perhaps be more muted -- but you should not make strong assumptions about the magnitude of the issue in text that you can't analyze directly.
