# Scene List (v3)
This document breaks down the 15-beat outline (v10) into a granular, 40-scene list. Each scene is a distinct unit of action with a specific POV.

Format: [Scene #] [Day #] [POV Character] [Location] [Fear Level (and/or Key Emotion)] [Milieu Note]

ACT 1: THE FAILING WORLD (Beats 1-4)

BEAT 1: COLD OPEN (The Catalyst)

1.1 [Day 1 - Evening] [TEVA] [Vitarium (Kiva)] [HIGH (Grief & Rage)] - Teva watches the dimming cultures as her grandmother fails the protocol. The yazhi dies. Teva's internal rage solidifies.

BEAT 2: UNSETTLED NORMALCY & SET-UP

2.1 [Day 2 - Morning] [KEO] [Enclave Perimeter] [LOW (Anxiety)] - Keo trains Noli. His bravado (masking anxiety) is evident.

2.2 [Day 2 - Morning] [BENAL] [Family Dwelling] [LOW (Frustration)] - Benal studies his math. His parent's dismissal ("do something real"). His shame/isolation.

2.3 [Day 2 - Morning] [TEVA] [Village Center (Yazhi Pool)] [LOW (Cold Rage)] - Teva drills yazhi on croc protocols. Her internal monologue contrasts the "useless" drill with the real threat (the plague). [Milieu: A sudden, driving, warm rainstorm. The rain comes down in sheets, and the yazhi (Joss, Miri) huddle under a leaking fern-thatch roof. Teva welcomes the respite from her overheating.]

BEAT 3: THE DEBATE (Public & Private)

3.1 [Day 2 - Evening] [KEO] [Council Chamber] [RISING (Frustration)] - Keo attends the public Council meeting. He witnesses the adults' paralysis and fear.

3.2 [Day 2 - Night] [KEO] [Clandestine Location (Kiva entrance)] [RISING (Adrenaline)] - Teva confronts him. "I'm going." Her conviction is terrifying. [Milieu: Teva confronts him in the 'echoing, narrow cleft' leading to the Vitarium, where their whispers are 'unnaturally loud'. The air is 'visibly damp' (mist) from the rain.]

3.3 [Day 2 - Night] [KEO] [Clandestine Location] [RISING (Resolve)] - Benal arrives, insisting he go. Keo sees Benal's visible terror and is awed by his courage. Keo agrees (loyalty, crush, and now, respect). [Milieu: Benal arrives, 'his tall frame shaking,' clutching a 'biodegradable data-slate'. He's 'gasping' from the run, his poor endurance obvious.]

BEAT 4: BREAK INTO TWO (The Theft)

4.1 [Day 2 - Late Night] [KEO] [His Dwelling (Night)] [HIGH (Guilt)] - Keo looks at his sleeping parents. The weight of his betrayal (the guilt) is the scene's focus. [Milieu: He looks at his parents sleeping on 'woven fern-fiber mats'. He can smell the 'faint, musky scent of their Explorer's gear' (pheromone barrier, sweat, leather) and it fills him with guilt.]

4.2 [Day 2 - Late Night] [KEO] [Suit Repository] [EXTREME (Heist Tension)] - The physical act of the theft. Gazes longingly at metal-tipped spears and other old-tech weapons, but knows that to take them would be the ultimate taboo, has to be satisfied with bio-safe weapons. Nearly getting caught. [Milieu: He takes 'bio-safe' weapons: a '2.5-meter croc-spike' and a 'razor-club'. He has to force himself not to look at the forbidden 'old-tech' metal spears, machetes, and shock-prods.]

4.3 [Day 2 - Pre-Dawn] [KEO] [Perimeter] [EXTREME (Resolve)] - Meeting Teva/Benal. Slipping past the watchers. The final, irreversible step into the jungle. [Milieu: A dense, ground-level fog rolls in. As they move, they freeze at the sharp, clicking vocalizations of an *Acheroraptor* pack hunting inside the fog, just meters away (a 'dread' encounter).]

ACT 2: THE MUDWALK (Beats 5-10)

(BEAT 5: B-Story - Woven into all scenes)

BEAT 6: FUN & GAMES (The "Promise of the Premise")

6.1 [Day 3] [TEVA] [Riverbank] [SPIKING (Dread)] - The trio argues about how to cross the first river. Teva's navigation skills and suit give her the authority. [Milieu: The first major rains have begun. The river is visibly swollen, fast, and opaque with mud. The bank is slick, black mud littered with rotting ferns and broken, plate-sized Ginkgo leaves. The rain plasters Teva's hair to her face, but she's grateful it's refilling their water-gourds and washing away the nutty, oily scent of the dried crawlers and piñons in their fieldpacks.]

6.2 [Day 3] [TEVA] [First River] [SPIKING (Panic)] - The crossing. A croc brushes her suit. She fights her suit's thermals and her own terror. [Milieu: A steady, light-to-medium rain continues, 'stippling' the surface and masking their vibrations. She fights the 'warm, suffocating press' of the suit as the croc brushes her, its hide feeling like a rough log.]

6.3 [Day 4] [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [RISING (Dread)] - The environment closes in. His super-senses are overwhelmed. Claustrophobia. [Milieu: A 'bait and switch': a clearing with clouds of hand-sized, iridescent blue butterflies (Lepidoptera), followed by steaming 'sauna-heat' and swarms of 'protein-seeking' flies that crawl on his eyes and mouth.]

6.4 [Day 5] [BENAL] [Deep Jungle] [PARALYZING (Panic)] - The Madtsoiidae (constrictor) attack. Pure, silent terror. Keo/Teva save him. [Milieu: The constrictor is 'the color of dead leaves and shadow.' Its attack is 'crushing, breathless silence,' and all he smells is 'the snake's musky reek and his own terror'.]

6.5 [Day 7] [KEO] [Open Savanna] [LOW (Hubris)] - The sunfever trek. Keo (no suit) feels fine, pushing the pace. His bravado is high. He forces a grin at Benal, who is still pale from the snake attack (6.4), "Next time, try not to look so delicious. You're making them hungry." [Milieu: Brutal, unfiltered, midday sun; shimmering heat. The 'savanna' is a sea of 'head-high ferns and cycads'. In the distance, he spots a herd of *Kritosaurus*, 'their calls like low, mournful horns'. His throat is parchment-dry, and he knows they're down to their last half-canteen of water; they need rain, or they'll be in crisis by nightfall.]

6.6 [Day 7] [TEVA] [Open Savanna] [HIGH (Weakness)] - Same trek, her POV. Her suit is struggling with thermal load. She is dizzy, near collapse, but hides it. [Milieu: Her POV: The suit's HUD is 'flickering with red heat warnings.' The sun is 'a physical weight,' and the *Kritosaurus* calls are 'a dull, throbbing headache'.]

BEAT 7: MIDPOINT (Noli's Death)

7.1 [Day 7 - Night] [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [LOW (Content)] - A rare moment of peace. Keo is playing with Noli, sharing food. [Milieu: The star-gazing scene: a windless, perfectly clear night. They are eating 'roasted 'grounder' meat' and 'sweet, mealy 'dinosaur-fruit' (*Annonaceae*)'. Noli proudly drags a fresh-killed grounder into camp. Keo roasts the small mammal, and they share the precious carne with foraged 'dinosaur-fruit', a rare and risky feast far better than their dry "journey-pan".]

7.2 [Day 8 - Dawn] [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [SHOCK] - The Quetzalcoatlus attack. It's over in seconds. The sky is empty. [Milieu: The *Quetzalcoatlus* attacks at dawn, using the 'low, blinding sun at its back' to mask its approach. It is a 'sudden, impossible shadow' that moves 'faster than thought'. The pterosaur was almost certainly drawn by the scent of Noli's kill from the night before.]

7.3 [Day 8 - Dawn] [KEO] [Camp (Open Clearing)] [GRIEF (Numb)] - The silence. Teva moves his pack for him. Benal just sits nearby. Their quiet, physical presence is the first act of true compassion. [Milvieu: The 'deafening, ringing silence' after the attack. Keo is staring at a single, 'blood-spattered purple feather' from Noli. Benal just sits, 'methodically picking a fern apart'.]

BEAT 8: BAD GUYS CLOSE IN

8.1 [Day 8] [TEVA] [Jungle Undergrowth] [HIGH (Dread)] - The shadow of the Quetzalcoatlus passes overhead. They hide. Teva is now terrified of the sky. [Milieu: A drenching, cold rain. They are trapped between the low-flying *Quetzalcoatlus* and a living carpet of 'hell ants' (*Haidomyrmecinae*) moving 'like a single, flowing oil-slick'. Benal, his eyes wide, whispers, "Sky or ground. Pick your death," and Teva whispers back, "Shut up, Benal," but she feels a flash of dark, shared humor. Keo also snorts.]

8.2 [Day 8] [KEO] [Gulch/Ravine] [HIGH (Reckless Rage)] - Keo's injury. He takes a stupid risk trying to climb (e.g., against a pack of Razortails), driven by grief over Noli. [Milieu: The ground is slick, unstable clay from the rain, causing his fall. He was climbing to get a 'lookout', falling onto 'sharp-edged limestone scree' and 'bright red *Gnetophyte* berries'.]

8.3 [Day 8 - Night] [TEVA] [Camp (Night)] [HIGH (Exhaustion)] - Tending Keo's wound. Her suit is failing. The "POV Irony" scene (caring for him, while we know he has a crush). As she's tending Keo's wound, he groans, "Careful," and Teva, her hands shaking from cold, snaps, "Be quiet or be bait. Your choice." [Milieu: The cold, miserable, all-night rain continues, threatening Teva's failing thermal regulation. They huddle under a 'leaking roof of waxy fern fronds'.]

8.4 [Day 8 - Night] [KEO] [Camp (Night/Fever)] [DISORIENTATION] - Keo's Temporal Flash (the symbol). He's feverish, dismisses it. [Milieu: His Temporal Flash is 'a gleaming, impossible symbol' and the 'smell of ozone and the ocean,' mixed with the 'bitter, herbal taste' of the salve on his wound. Through the fever-haze, he's vaguely aware of Benal sitting watch, his frail form a surprisingly steady silhouette against the rain, and Keo feels a wave of pure gratitude.]

BEAT 9: ALL IS LOST (The Offshore Journey)

9.1 [Day 11] [BENAL] [The Coast] [HIGH (Dread)] - They find the raft. It's a wreck. Benal's absolute terror of the open water. [Milieu: They arrive at low tide: 'a kilometer of treacherous, croc-infested mudflats.' On the horizon: the 'wall of black' of an approaching tropical cyclone. Solution: Benal spots a 'path of chaos'—massive sea turtles laying eggs, creating a 'frenzied distraction' for the crocs, giving them a corridor.]

9.2 [Day 11 - Night] [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Panic)] - The storm hits. The raft is tossing. [Milieu: The full fury of the cyclone hits. The raft is an 'old-tech' remnant, 'corroded polymer and metal,' and the waves are 'black, moving mountains'.]

9.3 [Day 11 - Night] [BENAL] [Raft (Open Water)] [EXTREME (Terror)] - The Mosasaur attacks. The raft shatters. Benal is plunged into the dark water. [Milieu: The *Mosasaur* attacks. He sees its eye, 'as large as his head, ancient and cold.' The 'smell of brine and dead fish' from its breath washes over him. He realizes with a lurch of panic that his fieldpack—containing his math, and all their remaining "journey-pan," dried crawlers, and piñons—is gone, lost to the sea.]

9.4 [Day 12 - Dawn] [BENAL] [Coral Bank (Genesis Site)] [DESPAIR] - Washing up. Battered. Finding Keo, then Teva. They've "failed." [Milieu: They wash up in the 'eerie, unnatural calm of the cyclone's eye.' The bank is 'razor-sharp fossilized rudist bivalves' and 'black volcanic rock'. Small, iridescent crabs scatter.]

BEAT 10: DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

10.1 [Day 12] [TEVA] [Archive (Flooded Section)] [DESPAIR (Cold)] - Huddling, freezing
