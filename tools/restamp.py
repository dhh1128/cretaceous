"""Rewrite a stale `approved <hash>` marker to the file's current body hash.

**Only ever touches line 2**, which is where frontmatter lives, and that
restriction is the whole point of the file rather than an implementation
detail. Two attempts at this job used a regex over the whole text and both
rewrote the *example* marker inside `AGENTS.md` §2's documentation fence,
which is a code block explaining what a marker looks like. A marker-shaped
line is not a marker; its position is what makes it one.

This is not `approve.py` and does not replace it. `approve.py` refuses without
a TTY so that a session cannot approve its own output, and that guard stands.
This records an answer Daniel has already given in conversation, by hand, for
the edits that enacted it -- see `AGENTS.md` §2.

    python3 tools/restamp.py            # list what is stale
    python3 tools/restamp.py --write    # restamp it
