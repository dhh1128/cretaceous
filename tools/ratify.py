"""Ratify rule blocks. See tools/RULES.md.

    python3 tools/ratify.py <id> [<id>...]  # ratify, after confirming each

Ratifying is one word and a date, so editing the block by hand is a perfectly good
way to do it. This exists to date it for you, to refuse rules that have no checker,
and to show you what each one catches before you say yes.

**It requires a terminal.** That is the guard, not a convention: an agent's shell
has no TTY, so a session cannot ratify its own rule even if it decides to. The
approval frontmatter had no such guard and drifted for exactly that reason.
