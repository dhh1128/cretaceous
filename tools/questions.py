"""The open-question queue, and the rulings that were answered and never landed.

    python3 tools/questions.py             # both halves, the second one first
    python3 tools/questions.py --open      # only what is unanswered
    python3 tools/questions.py --landed    # only the answered-but-unpropagated check

**The second half is the one that exists because of a real failure, so it
prints first.** `Q-8HNV` — whether the drafted prose in `content/superseded/`
is an input to a scene map or set aside — sat in `scene-build-runbook.md` as
*unanswered* for five days after Daniel had answered it, in these words:
*"what was written about it in the superseded 1.x scenes is what I intended to
be true."* The answer was recorded, some of it was propagated, the rest was
not, and the file that asks the question never learned that it had one. A
later session then re-derived the answer from scratch and got a different one.

**An unanswered question costs a round trip. An answered one that nobody can
find costs the same round trip and his patience with it**, because he knows he
answered and cannot see why it is being asked again.

## How the landing check works, and what it cannot do

Ruling records live under `.ignored/`, which is gitignored and therefore
invisible to `corpus()` — every other instrument in `tools/` reads
`git ls-files` and so has never been able to see them at all. This reads that
directory directly.

**Only sections that actually record a decision are examined**, and that
restriction is the whole difference between an instrument and a nuisance. The
first version read every `##` section under `.ignored/` and reported 148 of
them, which is the corpus's own `allocation_off_day` failure repeating: an
analysis document is not a ruling, its prose was never meant to reach canon,
and a check that cannot tell them apart is one nobody will run twice. A
section qualifies on either of two marks — a heading that opens with a
decision verb, or a body that quotes him deciding.

Within those, it takes the section's own **emphasised phrases** — what the
record chose to bold or italicise — and asks whether each is findable anywhere
in the tracked corpus. A ruling that landed usually left its own words
somewhere.

**That is a lead, not a verdict, and the difference matters.** Canon routinely
rephrases a ruling rather than quoting it, so an absent phrase means *go look*
rather than *this was dropped*. The check is tuned to be noisy in the safe
direction: a false positive costs one grep, and a false negative is how five
days of the Council chamber's layout went missing.

## The open half

Gathers what is unanswered from the three places it lives — the register, the
scene-map invention ledgers, and the `[?]` marks — and groups them by **whose
ground they sit on**, which is the one ordering that can be computed honestly.

**It does not rank them, and the first version did.** That version scored each
item by *reach*: how many tracked files mention something it names. The number
came out measuring how common the words were, so three notes about cover art
scored in the fifties for saying *Teva*, and the scene-ledger items they
outranked were the ones actually blocking work. A proxy that confident and
that wrong is worse than no proxy, and this corpus already has a standing rule
about it — `allocation_off_day` was written, measured, found to cry wolf four
times in five, and deliberately left unregistered.

**What can be computed is the ground.** A `[?]` inside an **approved** file is
an exception sitting in settled material, so a reader standing on that page is
currently being told something the author has not agreed to — those come
first. Everything in an unapproved file is a draft note and can wait. Scene
ledgers sort by whether the scene is mapped, because an unsettled item under a
written map is holding up prose.

**Dependency order is a reader's job and this file will not pretend
otherwise.** Nothing mechanical can see that *who is in the room* gates
*whether Marek names Omya*, or that *what the three years measure* gates every
line Hesh speaks. Both of those were found by reading. Use this to know what
exists; use judgment to know what to ask first.
