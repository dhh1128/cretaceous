"""Record that Daniel has approved a file's current contents. See AGENTS.md §2.

    python3 tools/approve.py --list                 # every marker, and what is stale
    python3 tools/approve.py <file> [<file>...]     # stamp the current body hash
    python3 tools/approve.py --provisional <file>   # the weaker marker

The marker carries a hash of the body rather than a date. Nothing is typed by hand
and nothing is bumped; this writes it. A date had day granularity, which this corpus
defeats routinely, and a bare `approved` could not express re-approval at all,
because approved-to-approved is a no-op git cannot see.

**A session runs it**, with `--yes`, when Daniel has said yes in conversation.
The approval is his answer to a question put to him directly (AGENTS.md §1); this
script records that answer and does not constitute it. An earlier version refused
without a TTY on the theory that making him run it proved he had approved. It
proved nothing he had not already said, and cost his time on every approval.
In a terminal without `--yes` it still asks per file.
