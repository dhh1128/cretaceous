This is a great question. The equation is a perfect example of the "linguistic duality" (code-switching) from the milieu brief, but for mathematics. It's designed to be a compelling piece of storytelling, blending real-world physics with a narrative mystery.

To a reader with a math or physics background, this equation tells a fascinating story. Here’s a breakdown of what the terms signify and why it's "believable" in a sci-fi context.

### The "Believable" Part (The Hook for Savvy Readers)

The core of the equation, and the part that lends it immediate credibility, is this component:

$$\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$

Any reader with first-year physics knowledge will instantly recognize this. It’s the **Lorentz factor** (or, more precisely, its reciprocal, gamma), the heart of Albert Einstein's **Special Theory of Relativity**.

* **What it means:** This formula describes **time dilation**. It calculates how time ($T$) passes for an object moving at a certain velocity ($v$) relative to an observer, where ($c$) is the constant speed of light.
* **Why it's here:** Its presence is a massive piece of world-building. It tells the reader that the Enclave's "time travel" is not magic. It's rooted in 21st-century physics. The original scientists clearly understood that to travel in time, you must (at a minimum) solve the problems of relativistic velocity. It's the "hook" that makes the science feel "hard" and grounded.

### The "Story" Part (Breaking Down the Terms)

The rest of the equation builds a narrative *on top* of that real-world physics:

$T_d = T_o \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \cdot (f_{drift}?)$

Let's look at the "characters" in this story:

* **$T_o$ (Origin Time):** This is the baseline, the constant. It represents the "Time Zero" of the mission—the moment of their arrival, or the "fixed event" of the Chicxulub impact itself. It's the "anchor" they are trying to measure *from*.

* **$T_d$ (Destination Time):** This is the *result* Benal is trying to calculate. It's the "Drifted Time" or "Actual Time." If $T_o$ is "where we started," $T_d$ is "where (or when) we *actually* are now."

* **$\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$ (The Classical Solution):** This is the "known" part of the problem. The original scientists built this into the equation, presumably to account for the velocity of their transit. It's the "textbook" answer.

### The "Problem" Part (The Narrative Conflict)

This is the most important part of the equation from a story perspective:

* **$(f_{drift}?)$ (The "Fudge Factor" / The Mystery):** This is Benal's entire character arc in one variable.

A math-savvy reader will see the equation and think: "Okay, $T_d = T_o \cdot (\text{Lorentz Factor})$... but that's a *simple* relationship. It doesn't account for... well, *anything* else."

Benal's genius (and his frustration) is that he recognizes this. The equation *should* work, but it *doesn't*. The "real" $T_d$ doesn't match the $T_d$ the equation predicts. Therefore, there must be a missing variable.

This is Benal's $(f_{drift}?)$. He's trying to find the "function of drift." And in Scene 2.2, *he gives us his hypothesis for what it is*:

> "They didn't account for **cosmic expansion**... They anchored to a point in *space*, not a point in *spacetime*. The anchor is... unmoored."

This is a *brilliant* and highly believable sci-fi concept.

* **The Original Sin:** The original scientists (in their genius) used Special Relativity.
* **The Fatal Flaw:** They *forgot* to use **General Relativity**. Special Relativity works in a static, flat universe. But our universe is *not* static; it's expanding.
* **Benal's Struggle:** Over 66 million years, that "tiny" error (ignoring the universe's expansion) has compounded. The "point in space" they anchored to is no longer where they think it is. The "anchor" has "drifted" on the current of spacetime itself.
* **What is $(f_{drift}?)$?** It's Benal's attempt to calculate a 66-million-year-long General Relativity correction. He's trying to quantify the "asymptotic noise" and "cosmic expansion" that the original team dismissed or forgot.

**Conclusion:** The equation is the perfect "prop." It's not "real math," but it's built from real, recognizable physics. It immediately tells a sophisticated reader that Benal is smart, the problem is non-trivial, and the original, brilliant scientists made a tiny, fundamental error that has doomed their descendants—an error only Benal's "useless" abstract work can fix.
