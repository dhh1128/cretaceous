# **PALEOECOLOGICAL REPORT: YUCATAN PLATFORM, LATE MAASTRICHTIAN (ca. 66.0005 Mya)**

## **SECTION 1: GEOGRAPHY & TOPOGRAPHY**

### **1.1 Paleogeography**

* The location was not a peninsula but a broad, shallow marine carbonate platform, partially submerged beneath the proto-Caribbean Sea and southern Gulf of Mexico.1  
* The terrestrial environment consisted of low-lying coastal plains, lagoons, and estuaries at the margin of the North American continent.3  
* Extensive shallow marine areas supported large rudist bivalve banks, forming reef-like structures and shoals.5

### **1.2 Pre-Impact Geology**

* Surface geology was a thick sequence of Upper Cretaceous platform limestone, with layers of marl and evaporites (anhydrite, gypsum).6  
* This sedimentary sequence, several kilometers thick, is referred to as the "target rock" for the Chicxulub impactor.6  
* The vaporization of these carbonate and sulfate-rich rocks was the primary mechanism for the subsequent global climate catastrophe (impact winter and greenhouse warming).4  
* Beneath the sediments lay a much older granitic basement of the Maya Block, dating to the Carboniferous period.6

### **1.3 Topography**

* The terrestrial landscape was predominantly a low-relief coastal plain; significant highlands or mountains were absent.7  
* Topography was not perfectly flat; large-scale, subtle features like the shallow "Yucatan Trough" created broad basins and gentle swells, influencing drainage.6  
* Submarine ridges and basins existed offshore, but the emergent land was uniformly low-lying.5

### **1.4 Hydrology**

* The iconic cenotes and extensive karst (underground river) system of the modern Yucatan did NOT exist pre-impact.9  
* The cenotes are a post-impact feature, formed by the collapse of limestone along the buried crater's ring of faults.7  
* Pre-impact hydrology was dominated by surface water features: slow-moving rivers, freshwater swamps, marshes, and coastal lagoons.7

## **SECTION 2: CLIMATE & ATMOSPHERE**

### **2.1 Global Conditions**

* The Late Cretaceous was a "hothouse world" with a much warmer global climate than today; polar ice sheets were absent.11  
* Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were significantly higher than modern levels, driving a strong greenhouse effect.13  
* The temperature gradient between the equator and poles was much lower than at present.11  
* The late Maastrichtian was in a slight cooling phase relative to the mid-Cretaceous thermal maximum but remained substantially warmer than the modern era.11

### **2.2 Local Climate & Seasonality**

* The region was located in the tropical-subtropical belt, experiencing hot and humid conditions year-round.11  
* Mean annual temperature for paratropical regions in North America is estimated at 20-24 °C.15  
* Temperature-based seasons (winter/summer) were absent; seasonality was defined by precipitation.13  
* Rainfall was moderate and relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, suggesting a pattern of wet and dry seasons rather than a constant monsoon.13  
* The region's location makes it highly plausible that it experienced powerful, hurricane-like tropical cyclones.7

## **SECTION 3: FLORA**

### **3.1 Vegetation Structure & Characteristics**

* The dominant vegetation was a paratropical to subtropical broad-leaved evergreen woodland, not a dense, closed-canopy rainforest.13  
* The forest structure was characterized by an open canopy, allowing more sunlight to reach the forest floor.13  
* This open structure supported a dense, thick understory of shrubs, ferns, and cycads.12  
* The tallest, emergent trees towering above the main canopy were evergreen conifers, not flowering trees.13

### **3.2 Representative Plant Groups**

* Angiosperms (Flowering Plants): Formed the dominant main canopy layer.  
  * *Palmae* (Palm Family): Common components of the forest, representing an early diversification of palms.16  
  * *Lauraceae* (Laurel Family): Evergreen dicots, ancestors to modern bay laurels and avocados, were widespread.15  
  * *Fagaceae* (Beech/Oak Family): Early members of this family were present in southern North American floras.16  
  * *Juglandaceae* (Walnut Family): Ancestors of modern walnut and hickory trees were part of the ecosystem.16  
  * Aquatic Angiosperms: Relatives of lotuses, water cabbage, and cattails populated freshwater environments.17  
* Gymnosperms: Formed the emergent layer and parts of the understory.  
  * *Coniferales* (Conifers): The tallest trees in the ecosystem, likely similar to Araucaria (monkey puzzle trees) or podocarps.13  
  * *Cycadales* (Cycads): "Sago palm"-like plants that were a common and important part of the understory vegetation.17  
* Pteridophytes (Ferns & Allies): Abundant ground cover and understory plants.  
  * *Polypodiopsida* (True Ferns): A wide variety of ferns thrived in the shade of the woodland and in damp areas.12  
  * *Equisetum* (Horsetail): These primitive, reed-like plants grew in dense stands along rivers and in marshy areas.19
