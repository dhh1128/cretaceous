>I am writing a novel. I want help naming characters. I'd like names that feel somewhat unusual, that feel a bit foreign to a native English speaker, that are super easy to pronounce correctly, and that are a believable name to use in a fictional society that was snapshotted from a pool of about 200 Albuquerque residents who suddenly time traveled to the past and formed an isolated society for 2-3 centuries. In other words, it should be a name that shows influences from today's Albuquerque population (English, also possibly Latino or Pueblo/Navajo roots), but that has undergone 200-300 years of linguistic evolution.

>Please give me a list of 20 candidate male first names, 20 candidate female first names, and 20 candidate surnames. By each name, please give me a short note about a theoretical etymology.

🟢 R1 — Here’s a curated list of **names evolved from an Albuquerque-origin isolate**—200–300 years of drift yielding a soundscape that’s earthy, vowel-rich, and slightly simplified from modern English and Spanish phonetics. These names are meant to be **familiar yet distinctly not contemporary**, plausible in a world that’s evolved from a Southwestern melting pot of Anglo, Hispanic, and Indigenous roots.
