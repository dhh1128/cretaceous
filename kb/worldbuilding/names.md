## Names
Here’s a curated list of **names evolved from an Albuquerque-origin isolate**—200–300 years of drift yielding a soundscape that’s earthy, vowel-rich, and slightly simplified from modern English and Spanish phonetics. These names are meant to be **familiar yet distinctly not contemporary**, plausible in a world that’s evolved from a Southwestern melting pot of Anglo, Hispanic, and Indigenous roots.
